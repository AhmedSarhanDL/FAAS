# El Tor Circular Economy Project

## Overview

The El Tor Circular Economy project is a comprehensive initiative designed to create an integrated, sustainable agricultural system in the El Tor region. This project treats each agricultural unit (Azolla Farming, Biodiesel Production, Livestock Management, Vermicomposting/Biochar, Date Palms, Cactus Fig, Olives, etc.) as a separate, self-contained economic entity while ensuring they function together as an interconnected circular economy.

## Project Structure

This repository contains a LaTeX-based documentation system for the El Tor Circular Economy project. The structure is organized as follows:

```
el_tor_circular_economy/
├── main.tex                             # Master document integrating all unit reports
├── main_ar.tex                          # Arabic version of the master document
├── images/                              # Shared images, maps, diagrams, figures
├── units/                               # Individual economic units
│   ├── azolla_farming/                  # Azolla cultivation unit
│   ├── biodiesel_production/            # Biodiesel production unit
│   ├── livestock_management/            # Livestock management unit
│   ├── vermicomposting_biochar/         # Vermicomposting and biochar unit
│   ├── date_palm_cultivation/           # Date palm cultivation unit
│   ├── cactus_fig_cultivation/          # Cactus fig cultivation unit
│   └── olive_cultivation/               # Olive cultivation unit
├── shared_documents/                    # Cross-cutting documentation
└── appendices/                          # Supporting data and documentation
```

Each unit folder contains a standardized set of files:

- `overview.tex` - Brief unit description, goals, and vision
- `strategic_plan.tex` - Business model, market research, competitive positioning
- `operational_plan.tex` - Daily workflows, SOPs, production guidelines
- `financial_plan.tex` - Budgets, costs, revenue projections
- `resource_requirements.tex` - Machinery, labor, material inputs
- `risk_management.tex` - Potential risks and contingency measures
- `sustainability_plan.tex` - Environmental impacts and sustainability measures
- `integration_plan.tex` - Integration methods with other units

Arabic versions of each file are also included with the suffix `_ar`.

## Circular Economy Integration

The project is designed around circular economy principles, where:

1. **Waste is eliminated** - Outputs from one unit become inputs for another
2. **Resources are circulated** - Materials and nutrients flow between units
3. **Natural systems are regenerated** - Practices enhance rather than deplete natural capital

## Scientific Approach

The project incorporates scientific research and evidence-based practices, including:

- Provenance testing for optimal plant varieties
- Integrated pest management strategies
- Water-efficient irrigation systems
- Soil health management through organic inputs
- Carbon sequestration through biochar and perennial crops

## Getting Started

To compile the LaTeX documentation:

1. Ensure you have a LaTeX distribution installed (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX)
2. For English documentation: `pdflatex main.tex`
3. For Arabic documentation: `xelatex main_ar.tex` (requires appropriate Arabic fonts)

### Using the Compilation Scripts

Two compilation scripts are provided for convenience:

1. **Standard Compilation** (requires LaTeX installation):
   ```
   chmod +x compile_all.sh
   ./compile_all.sh
   ```

2. **Docker-based Compilation** (requires Docker, but no LaTeX installation):
   ```
   chmod +x compile_docker.sh
   ./compile_docker.sh
   ```

Both scripts will generate PDF files in the `output` directory.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project should follow the established file structure and naming conventions to maintain consistency across all units.
