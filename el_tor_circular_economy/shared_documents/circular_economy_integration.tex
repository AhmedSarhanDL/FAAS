\section{Circular Economy Integration}

\subsection{Circular Economy Principles}
The El Tor Circular Economy project is designed around three fundamental principles:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Design Out Waste and Pollution:} By considering the end-of-life impacts from the beginning, we create systems where materials and energy flow continuously without generating waste.
    
    \item \textbf{Keep Products and Materials in Use:} By designing for durability, reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling, we keep materials circulating in the economy rather than discarding them.
    
    \item \textbf{Regenerate Natural Systems:} By returning valuable nutrients to the soil and other ecosystems, we enhance natural capital rather than depleting it.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{System-Wide Resource Flows}

The El Tor Circular Economy creates a closed-loop system where outputs from one unit become inputs for another. The major resource flows include:
