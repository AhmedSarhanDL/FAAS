    \item \textbf{Plant Propagation:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Olive tree propagation through cuttings and grafting
        \item Date palm propagation through offshoots and tissue culture
        \item Management of mother plants for genetic preservation
        \item Implementation of advanced propagation techniques
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Seedling Care:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Climate-controlled growing environments
        \item Precision irrigation and fertigation systems
        \item Disease monitoring and prevention
        \item Growth stage management
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Research and Development:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Variety trials and selection
        \item Propagation technique optimization
        \item Climate adaptation research
        \item Disease resistance studies
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Capacity and Infrastructure}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Production Capacity:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Annual production of 2,000 olive seedlings
        \item Annual production of 1,000 date palm offshoots
        \item Expansion capability up to 5,000 total plants annually
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Facilities:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 2,000 m² greenhouse space
        \item 1,000 m² shadehouse area
        \item 500 m² mother plant section
        \item Laboratory and tissue culture facility
        \item Storage and processing areas
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Integration with Other Units}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Input Integration:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Vermicompost and biochar for growing media
        \item Treated water from water management unit
        \item Organic pest control materials
        \item Renewable energy for climate control
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Output Integration:}

        \item High-quality seedlings for cultivation units
        \item Research data and best practices
        \item Genetic material preservation
        \item Training and capacity building
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key Success Metrics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Seedling survival rate (target: >90\%)
    \item Genetic purity maintenance (100\%)
    \item Disease resistance levels
    \item Growth rate and uniformity
    \item Resource use efficiency
    \item Research and innovation outputs
\end{itemize}

This nursery unit plays a crucial role in ensuring the success of the olive and date palm cultivation units by providing high-quality, well-adapted planting material while contributing to the project's research and development objectives.
