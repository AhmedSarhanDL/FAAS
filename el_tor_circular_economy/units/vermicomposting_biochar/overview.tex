\section{Vermicomposting and Biochar Overview}

\subsection{Introduction to Soil Amendment Systems}

The Vermicomposting and Biochar unit serves as a critical hub within the El Tor Circular Economy, transforming organic waste streams into high-value soil amendments. This unit exemplifies the circular economy principles by closing nutrient loops, sequestering carbon, and enhancing soil fertility through biological and thermochemical processes. The integration of vermicomposting and biochar production creates synergistic benefits that exceed what either process could achieve independently.

    \item \textbf{Application Method:} For optimal results, Azolla-derived biochar should be:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Pre-charged with compost tea for 24-48 hours before application
        \item Mixed with vermicompost at a 1:2 ratio (biochar:vermicompost)
        \item Incorporated into the top 15-20 cm of soil where possible
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Seasonal Considerations:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Winter Application (Nov-Feb):} Focus on tree crops and preparation of spring planting beds
        \item \textit{Spring Application (Mar-May):} Vegetable beds and newly established plantings
        \item \textit{Summer Application (Jun-Aug):} Limited to maintenance of moisture-stressed crops

    \item \textbf{Processing Timeline:} Residues are collected weekly from the Biodiesel Production Unit and allowed to dry for 3-5 days before pyrolysis
    \item \textbf{Quality Control:} Residue batches are tested for oil content (target <3\%) to ensure efficient pyrolysis
    \item \textbf{Seasonality:} Production increases by 30-40\% during summer months (May-September) when Azolla growth and oil extraction are at maximum capacity
    \item \textbf{Cross-Reference:} Processing protocols coordinated with the Biodiesel Production Unit operational plan (Section 4.3)
\end{itemize}
