\section{Overview of Olive Cultivation Unit}

\subsection{Unit Description}
The Olive Cultivation Unit is a 45-Feddan (18.9 hectares) component of the El Tor Circular Economy project, designed to produce high-quality olive oil while integrating with other production units in a circular resource system. The unit will be developed in five phases from 2026 to 2031, ultimately hosting 4,500 drought-resistant olive trees suitable for oil production. The cultivation system employs sustainable practices including drip irrigation, biochar application, vermicompost utilization, and integration with livestock and poultry units.

\subsection{Strategic Importance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Economic Value:} Production of premium olive oil for local and export markets, creating a high-value product stream with strong market demand.
    
    \item \textbf{Resource Efficiency:} Implementation of water-efficient cultivation methods in an arid environment, demonstrating sustainable agriculture in water-scarce regions.
    
    \item \textbf{Circular Integration:} Serves as a key node in the project's circular economy, both receiving inputs from and providing outputs to other production units.
    
    \item \textbf{Carbon Sequestration:} Olive trees function as long-term carbon sinks, contributing to the project's climate mitigation objectives.
    
    \item \textbf{Biodiversity Enhancement:} Intercropping and agroforestry approaches increase biodiversity and ecosystem resilience.
