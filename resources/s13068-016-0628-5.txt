Abstract 
Background:  The quest for sustainable production of renewable and cheap biofuels has triggered an intensive 
search for domestication of the next generation of bioenergy crops. Aquatic plants which can rapidly colonize wet-
lands are attracting attention because of their ability to grow in wastewaters and produce large amounts of biomass. 
Representatives of Azolla species are some of the fastest growing plants, producing substantial biomass when grow-
ing in contaminated water and natural ecosystems. Together with their evolutional symbiont, the cyanobacterium 
Anabaena azollae, Azolla biomass has a unique chemical composition accumulating in each leaf including three 
major types of bioenergy molecules: cellulose/hemicellulose, starch and lipids, resembling combinations of terrestrial 
bioenergy crops and microalgae.
Results:  The growth of Azolla filiculoides in synthetic wastewater led up to 25, 69, 24 and 40 % reduction of NH4–N, 
NO3–N, PO4–P and selenium, respectively, after 5 days of treatment. This led to a 2.6-fold reduction in toxicity of the 
treated wastewater to shrimps, common inhabitants of wetlands. Two Azolla species, Azolla filiculoides and Azolla 
pinnata, were used as feedstock for the production of a range of functional hydrocarbons through hydrothermal 
liquefaction, bio-hydrogen and bio-ethanol. Given the high annual productivity of Azolla, hydrothermal liquefaction 
can lead to the theoretical production of 20.2 t/ha-year of bio-oil and 48 t/ha-year of bio-char. The ethanol production 
from Azolla filiculoides, 11.7 × 103 L/ha-year, is close to that from corn stover (13.3 × 103 L/ha-year), but higher than 
from miscanthus (2.3 × 103 L/ha-year) and woody plants, such as willow (0.3 × 103 L/ha-year) and poplar (1.3 × 103 L/
ha-year). With a high C/N ratio, fermentation of Azolla biomass generates 2.2 mol/mol glucose/xylose of hydrogen, 
making this species a competitive feedstock for hydrogen production compared with other bioenergy crops.
Conclusions:  The high productivity, the ability to grow on wastewaters and unique chemical composition make 
Azolla species the most attractive, sustainable and universal feedstock for low cost, low energy demanding, near zero 
maintenance system for the production of a wide spectrum of renewable biofuels.

Background
The deleterious consequences of the extensive usage 
of arable lands to produce biofuels have triggered an 
intensive search for the next generation of energy crops 
which can grow on marginal lands not used for food 
production, forestry, or other uses of social value, includ-
ing nature conservation. The use of wastewater as a 
source of reclaimed water and key nutrients for grow-
ing energy crops would significantly reduce the cost and 
energy requirement for biofuel production. Since the 
utilization of wastewater is very limited for most of ter-
restrial crops, attention has been shifted towards the use 
of aquatic plants and microalgae. Microalgae have shown 
obvious advantages in the production of biofuels com-
pared with energy crops. Apart from their high growth

rates and substantial lipid/triacylglycerol (TAG) yields, 
microalgae can grow in wastewater (animal, municipal 
and mining wastewaters) efficiently removing the pri-
mary nutrients (C, N and P), heavy metals and micropo-
llutants, and they do not compete with crops for arable 
lands [1–3]. However, one of the major challenges of 
microalgal biotechnology for biofuel production is the 
high cost of harvesting [1, 4].
Recently, aquatic plants which rapidly colonize lakes and 
contaminated wetlands have attracted significant attention 
because of their high growth rates, high biomass produc-
tion, bioremediation capacity, easy maintenance and easy 
harvest [5–7]. Growing these plants in wastewater can 
significantly improve the water quality by accumulating 
nutrients and heavy metals, and by regulating the oxygen 
balance [8, 9]. Various aquatic floating plants have been 
proposed as agents of choice for the bioremediation of 
wastewaters because of these important features. Among 
them, the most used are representatives of the Lemnaceae 
or duckweed which have been employed for over 20 years 
to recover nutrients from wastewaters and conversion of 
the generated biomass into biofuels [10–17]. The average 
annual yield of duckweed is 39.2–44 t dw/ha-year which 
is higher than the yields of the main bioenergy grasses: 
switchgrass (5.2–26  t/ha-year), poplar (9–15  t/ha-year) 
and miscanthus (5.0–44  t/ha-year) (Additional file  1: 
Table S1). Apart from efficient rates of nitrogen (N) and 
phosphorus (P) uptake, duckweed species can accumu-
late microelements and heavy metals to concentrations 
100,000 times greater than in the surrounding water [18]. 
Because of their high growth rates and accumulation of 
starch (up to 45.7 % DW), duckweed species were used as 
feedstocks for bio-ethanol production [19, 20].
Azolla (mosquito fern, water fern) is a genus with seven 
species found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands through-
out the world, from temperate to tropical regions [21] 
(Additional file 2: Figure S1). This aquatic plant is one of 
the fastest growing plants capable of doubling its biomass 
every 5–6 days [21]. Growing on artificial media, waste-
waters and maturation ponds, its productivity can vary 
between 2.9 and 5.8  g dw/m2-day (10.5–21.1  t  dw/ha-
year, Additional file 1: Table S1) [22–25]. Growing in nat-
ural ecosystems, rivers, lagoons and irrigation channels, 
Azolla plants can bloom with a rate up to 25.6–27.4 g dw/
m2-day (93.4–100  t  dw/ha-year) [25]. Their growth in 
wastewaters is associated with the removal of the key 
wastewater nutrients such as N and P, with rates of up to 
2.6 t N/ha-year and 0.434 t P/ha-year, respectively [23–
26]. Azolla can also grow efficiently in nitrogen-depleted 
media using the nitrogen fixing capacity of its symbiont, 
the endophytic cyanobacterium, Anabaena azollae Stras-
burger (A. azollae), which grows within its leaf cavities 
(Additional file 2: Figure S1). As a result, Azolla’s growth 
is associated with the fixation of nitrogen of up to 1.1 t/
ha-year, which is significantly higher than the nitrogen 
fixation rate of legumes (0.4 t N/ha-year) [21, 25, 27].
The chemical composition of Azolla comprises a 
unique mixture of key molecules found in lignocellulosic, 
starch- and oil-producing terrestrial bioenergy crops and 
microalgal/cyanobacterial representatives. A. filiculoides 
contains starch (up to 6  % dw), cellulose/hemicellulose 
(up to 35  % dw) and lipids (8  % dw) (Additional file  1: 
Table S1, Additional file 3: Table S2). As a result, growing 
under natural conditions (with biomass production up to 
100 t dw/ha-year) Azolla biomass can accumulate up to 
6 t dw/ha-year of starch and 34 t dw/ha-year of cellulose/
hemicellulose. The Azolla biomass can also accumulate 
up to 8 t/ha-year of neutral lipids which is higher than 
from soybean, sunflower, rapeseed and oil palm [28–30]. 
Furthermore, the composition of the fatty acid methyl 
esters produced after transesterification of Azolla/A. 
azollae lipids, C16:0, C18:2 and C18:3, meets the crucial 
requirements of fuel density, cetane number and iodine 
value for biodiesel set by the EN14214 standard [28].
The unique chemical composition makes Azolla species 
an attractive feedstock for a range of biofuels. We have 
previously shown that pyrolysis of A. filiculoides grown 
in wastewater produces up to 33 % of bio-oil containing 
a range of petrochemicals, including straight-chain C10–
C21 alkanes which can be directly used as a glycerine-
free component of biodiesel [24]. In this work, we used 
A. filiculoides for the treatment of a synthetic wastewater 
which simulates the characteristics of effluents from typi-
cal textile dyeing, finishing and laundry detergent pro-
duction industries. To increase the toxicity to common 
water inhabitants, such as crustaceans (P. australiensis), 
this wastewater was supplemented with selenium (SeO2, 
0.8 mg/L). For the first time, the A. filiculoides biomass was 
used as feedstock for production of a range of functional 
hydrocarbons through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), 
and for bio-hydrogen production. Two of the most com-
mon Azolla species, A. filiculoides, and A. pinnata, found 
in temperate, warm and tropical regions and common for 
Australia and India, were used as feedstock for produc-
tion of bio-ethanol. Our results showed that the ability of 
Azolla species to treat wastewater, and their unique chem-
ical compositions resembling combinations of terrestrial 
bioenergy crops and microalgae/cyanobacteria, makes this 
plant the most attractive universal feedstock for a low cost, 
low energy demanding, near zero maintenance system for 
the production of a wide spectrum of biofuels.
Results and discussion
Treatment of synthetic wastewater with Azolla filiculoides
For the bioremediation experiment, selenium-rich syn-
thetic wastewater (SeSW) was prepared by mixing a high

concentration of phosphates (PO4–P), 1.3  g/L with a 
moderate amount ammonia (NH4–N), 55 mg/L and low 
concentration of nitrates (NO3–N), 15 mg/L (Additional 
file 4: Table S3). This composition simulates the charac-
teristics of effluents from typical textile dyeing, finishing 
and laundry detergent production industries [31, 32]. The 
wastewater was supplemented with 0.8 mg/L of SeO2. In 
this experiment, we used 5-day treatment of SeSW by A. 
filiculoides. Growth rates of some of aquatic plants grow-
ing on wastewaters normally increase exponentially after 
a lag phase observed over the first 4–5  days when the 
biomass does not change significantly [20]. This period, 
however, is associated with the intensive absorption of 
the key nutrients from wastewaters, which leads to the 
strong exponential growth of aquatic plants after the lag 
phase [33, 34]. Removal of nutrients in the SeSW over the 
first 5 days of treatment by A. filiculoides did not lead to 
statistically significant changes (P ≤ 0.05) in biomass pro-
duction (0.3 ± 0.1 g dw). However, it led to up to 25.4 % 
uptake of NH4–N, 69.5 % uptake of NO3–N and 24.3 % 
uptake of PO4–P from 100  % SeSW (Table  1; Fig.  1). 
Diluted (50 %) SeSW was less stressful to the A. filicu-
loides as reflected in the higher rates of nutrient uptake: 
33.4, 93 and 39.8  % for NH4–N, NO3–N and PO4–P, 
respectively. Absorption rates of nutrients by A. filicu-
loides were reported earlier by several research groups 
[21, 23–26, 35, 36]. 
Treatment of SeSW with A. filiculoides led to 40  % 
uptake of Se from 100  % SeSW and 76  % uptake from 
50 % SeSW with absorption rates of 47.6 µg Se/L-day and 
39.9 µg Se/L-day, respectively (Fig. 2; Table 2). This was 
correlated with accumulation rates of 158.8  µg of Se/g 
dw-day in A. filiculoides from 100 % SeSW and 133.5 µg 
of Se/g dw-day from 50 % SeSW (Table 2). This absorp-
tion efficiency represents 85 and 83 % of the theoretical 
maximum absorption value for 50  % SeSW and 100  % 
SeSW, respectively. An approximately similar absorp-
tion rate of Se was shown by another Azolla representa-
tive, Azolla caroliniana, which absorbed up to 1 mg Se/g 
dw from 2.5 mg/L Se solution over 2 weeks of treatment 
[37]. This is higher than for other aquatic plants, Salvinia 
rotundifolia (0.7 mg Se/g dw), Lemna minor (500 mg Se/g 
dw) and Eichhornia (300 mg Se/g dw) [37].
The survival rate of P. australiensis exposed to dilu-
tions of SeSW is shown in Additional file  5: Figure S2. 
There was zero survival (0 %) when they were exposed for 
96 h to 100 % untreated (control) SeSW. No live shrimps 
were also observed in either 80 % or 50 % SeSW. After 
treatment with A. filiculoides, the toxicity of the SeSW 
was reduced 2.6-fold with LC50 increased from 11.22 
to 29.80  %. This indicated that when 100  % SeSW was 
treated by A. filiculoides, its toxicity was significantly 
reduced after only 5 days of treatment.
Biofuel production from Azolla
Ultimate and proximate analyses of Azolla filiculoides
The results of the proximate and ultimate analyses of the 
A. filiculoides sample, including the total content of vola-
tiles, moisture, fixed carbon and ash (i.e. inorganic com-
ponents of the samples), are summarized in Additional 
file 6: Table S4. Total volatiles collected at 950 °C repre-
sent 88 % of the total product. The total product had 11 % 
moisture, 7.3  % ash and 4.4  % fixed carbon. Proximate 
analysis showed the key elements to comprise 46.2  % 
C, 7.4 % H, 3.0 % N, 43.2 % O and 0.2 % S (calculated by 
difference).
Thermogravimetric analyses of Azolla filiculoides
TGA-DTG analysis of the A. filiculoides sample was 
carried out at a temperature range of 23–900 °C with a 
heating rate of 10 °C/min under a nitrogen atmosphere 
and is shown in Fig.  3. TGA and DTG curves revealed 
the three stages of decomposition of the A. filiculoides 
in the pyrolysis process; similar results were reported by 
Agrawal and Chakraborty [38]. The biomass underwent 
three phases of weight loss, one between 154 and 160 °C, 
the second at 180 and 580 °C and the third at around 580 
and 900 °C. The first zone represents a slight weight (7 %) 
loss caused by dehydration of the biomass sample. Most 
of the weight loss (51 %) due to pyrolysis took place in 
the second zone, where most of the volatiles are released; 
the strong peak denotes the decomposition of proteins, 
carbohydrates, and lipids [39]. In the third zone, there is 
decomposition of the carbonaceous product, and thus 
the weight loss is mainly due to gasification where highly 
non-volatile carbon compounds vaporize forming CO 
and CO2 due to the high temperatures [38].
Hydrothermal liquefaction of Azolla filiculoides
Hydrothermal liquefaction of A. filiculoides was per-
formed using distilled water as solvent at 260, 280 and 
300 °C with residence times of 15 min. Reaction condi-
tions were selected based on our earlier studies and lit-
erature to understand the effect of temperature on the 
bio-oil product yield of A. filiculoides under subcriti-
cal water [40]. The product distribution of the HTL-
treated A. filiculoides sample is presented in Fig. 4. The 
total bio-oil yields were 15.83, 21.50 and 16.0 % at 260, 
280 and 300  °C, respectively; thus the maximum yield 
was obtained at 280 °C. The total bio-oil was composed 
of the ether fraction (Bio-oil1) obtained from extraction 
of the liquid portion, and the acetone fraction (Bio-oil2) 
obtained from extraction of the solid fraction (“Methods” 
section). Bio-oil2 had high viscosity and was seen to be a 
tarry liquid. The solid residue yields decreased continu-
ously from 66.83 to 33.83 % as the temperature increased 
from 260 to 300 °C. The yield of the gases decreased in

the transition from 260 to 280 °C. When the temperature 
was higher than 280 °C, the yield of gases increased to 
7.1 % [40]. HTL of A. filiculoides biomass showed a simi-
lar distribution of the two major products, biogas and 
bio-char, with data obtained after pyrolysis [41] with an 
average biogas of 6.05 and 12 % for HTL and pyrolysis, 
respectively, and bio-char around 50  % for both. HTL 
generated a higher level of bio-oil, up to 21.5 % (14 % for 
pyrolysis). Similar results were obtained when compared 
with the yields of bio-oil obtained from both pyrolysis 
and HTL of microalgae [41].
In addition to the material balance data, conversion on 
the basis of total organic carbon (TOC) obtained after 
hydrothermal liquefaction at different temperatures was 
investigated, and the results are presented in Additional 
file 7: Table S5. There was 46.9 % organic carbon in the 
feed which translates to 2.8  g of organic carbon in the 
6  g of the sample used for hydrothermal liquefaction. 
The conversion regarding organic carbon increased from 
13.93 to 48.93 % with increase in temperature from 260 
to 300 °C. The results indicated that at a lower tempera-
ture, the decomposition of biomass was incomplete and 
left a large amount of unreacted biomass which may sup-
press the bio-oil formation. The rise in temperature was 
able to accelerate the decomposition of the feedstock 
and benefited the bio-oil formation; however, a further 
increase in temperature, higher than 280 °C in our exper-
iments, would break down the previously formed bio-oil/
intermediates to gases and water-soluble products and 
thus led to a decrease in the bio-oil yield. The reducing 
yield of the solid residue (bio-char) suggested an increase 
in the overall biomass conversion when the temperature 
was raised from 260 to 300 °C.

3200–3405  cm−1 is attributed to the O–H or N–H 
stretching vibration caused by water or O–H groups or 
N–H groups present in bio-oil [42] (Fig.  5B). A broad 
absorbance was displayed at around 3314  cm−1 for the 
raw material, which indicated a high content of carbohy-
drates and proteins [43] (Fig. 5A).
The bio-oils showed a weaker absorbance at 3200–
3405 cm−1, suggesting that both carbohydrates and pro-
teins were decomposed in the HTL process (Fig. 5B). The 
bands from 2854 to 2950 cm−1 were stronger for all the 
bio-oils due to the C–H stretching vibrations, indicat-
ing the presence of alkyl C–H groups. The C=O stretch-
ing vibration around at 1645–1720  cm−1 in the bio-oils 
indicates the presence of ketones, aldehydes, esters or 
acids [42]. The bending vibration bands at around 1580–
1650  cm−1 indicate the presence of the N–H groups of 
amine. The bands in the region from 1430 to 1480 cm−1 
were attributed to α-CH2 bending vibrations present 
in the bio-oils. The presence of C–N stretching bands 
around at 1266–1342 cm−1 in the bio-oils is due to aro-
matic amine groups. Also, some other absorbance peaks 
appearing at 780–850 cm−1 are ascribed to the C–H out 
of plane bending vibrations from aromatics [42]. The band 
at 1040 cm−1 appeared only in the absorption profile of 
the A. filiculoides feed, and could be C–O connected with 
hydroxyl groups which were dehydrated after liquefaction. 
Overall, the spectra of the bio-oil1 samples from HTL at 
the different temperatures show the same peaks, indicat-
ing the presence of the same functional groups, and were 
the various peaks obtained in the NMR spectra.
NMR analysis of bio‑oil
NMR analysis of the bio-oil1 samples was undertaken 
to understand the ratios of chemical environments of 
the protons. The NMR spectra provided complemen-
tary functional group information to the FTIR spectra 
and the ability to quantify and compare integration areas 
between spectra. Similar to FT-IR, the 1H NMR spectra 
showed a high percentage of aliphatic functional groups 
for all bio-oils, and a summary of integrated peak area

regions assigned to different functional group classes is 
provided in Fig. 6. The most up field region of the spec-
tra, from 0.5 to 1.5  ppm, represents aliphatic protons 
attached to carbon atoms at least two bonds away from 
a C=C or heteroatom (O or N). The next integral region 
from 1.5 to 3.0 ppm represents protons on aliphatic car-
bon atoms that may be bonded to a C=C double bond. 
All the bio-oils had a higher percentage of protons in the 
spectral region from 0.5 to 3.0 ppm. They had a higher 
percentage (63.15–71.76 %) of protons in the region from 
0.5 to 1.5 than the region from 1.5 to 3.0 (18.73–28.8 %) 
which is possibly due to the large number of nitrogenous 
and oxygenated compounds that have been shown to res-
onate in this area [42, 44] which may be derived from the 
high protein content of the feedstock.
The next portion of the 1H NMR spectrum at 3.0–
4.5  ppm represents methoxyl protons [45] or a methyl-
ene group that joins two aromatic rings; very low proton 
percentages were observed in this region. All bio-oils 
displayed a low percentage of methoxy/carbohydrate 
functionality (4.5–6.0  ppm). In this region, the maxi-
mum proton percentage values of the bio-oils were 4.33 
and 4.32 % for liquefactions at 260 and 280 °C, the mark-
edly lower value of 0.94 % for liquefaction at 300 °C. The 
region of the spectrum between 6.0 and 8.5 ppm corre-
sponds to the aromatic region. The maximum proton con-
tent of around 7.2 % in this region was obtained for the 
bio-oil made at 300  °C. Aromatic/heteroaromatic func-
tionality was observed in all the bio-oils (6.0–8.5  ppm)

in agreement with the findings from FT-IR spectroscopy. 
The downfield spectrum regions (8.5–10 ppm) arise from 
the aldehydes. Aldehyde functionality (9.5–10.0  ppm) 
was absent from all bio-oils despite the C=O func-
tional groups (1645–1720 cm−1) observed by FT-IR. The 
appearance of such FT-IR bands can also be due to other 
carbonyl-bearing groups like protonated carboxylic acids, 
carboxylic acid esters, amides and ketones.
GC–MS analysis of bio‑oil
GC–MS was utilized to further understand the compo-
sition of the liquid product and to confirm the findings 
of the FT-IR and NMR analyses. GC–MS clearly showed 
that the liquefaction temperature affected the compo-
nents of bio-oils1. The identification of the main peaks of 
compounds was performed using the NIST mass spec-
tral database. The HTL experiments resulted in bio-oils 
which arose from the decomposition of lignin, proteins, 
flavonoids and lipids along with a range of carbohy-
drate-derived compounds. The components of bio-oils 
were identified as mono- and polycyclic aromatic com-
pounds, ketones, aldehydes, esters, alcohols, amides and 
other nitrogen-containing compounds (including amides 
and N-heterocyclic compounds) and hydrocarbons. A 
semi-quantitative analysis was performed by calculat-
ing the relative percentage of the area of the chromato-
graphic peaks with results shown in Table  3. The main 
compounds observed from the hydrothermal liquefac-
tion of A. filiculoides were methyl pyrazine, 2-methyl 
2-cyclopenten-1-one, phenol, 2-methoxy phenol, 3-pyri-
dinol, catechol, l-proline, N-butoxy carbonyl- butyl ester, 
Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and beta-sitosterol. As the 
hydrothermal liquefaction temperature varied from 260 
to 300 °C, there was production of different compounds 
as well as different proportions of compounds. The area 
percentage of phenolic compounds such as phenol (6.1–
18.8 area  %) and catechol (10.0–15.7 area  %) increased 
as the temperature increased from 260 to 280  °C, but 
then decreased to 11.1 area % for phenol and 11.8 area % 
for catechol for 300 °C. The phenolics in the bio-oil from 
A. filiculoides were likely produced from the lignin or 
carbohydrate portion of the biomass [46]. Nitrogenated 
compounds are formed by decarboxylation, deamination, 
dehydration, depolymerization and decomposition reac-
tions of proteins [47, 48]. The highest percentage area of 
3-pyrindiol (13.3 area %) was observed at the lowest tem-
perature of 260 °C and decreased to 11.9 and 10.1 area  % 
for 280 and 300 °C, respectively. In addition, highest area 
about (13.6, 12.4 and 8.7 area %) at 260, 280 and 300 °C 
was observed. As the composition of the liquid product is 
so complex, further upgrading, such as denitrogenation 
and deoxygenation, would be necessary to make the bio-
oil suitable for engine fuels.
The composition of molecules obtained in the bio-oil 
from HTL was compared to the spectrum of molecules 
identified in the pyrolysis-generated bio-oil [41]. Unlike 
HTL, pyrolysis is the thermochemical decomposition of 
dry organic matter with a moisture content below 10  % 
mass fraction in the absence of oxygen, at atmospheric 
pressure and higher temperatures (350–550 °C) [49]. Both 
thermochemical technologies showed a great potential for 
converting the whole Azolla biomass into bio-oils which 
have higher energy densities than the initial biomass feed-
stock. Bio-oils from both thermochemical reactions have a 
very complex composition as a result of depolymerization

and decomposition of biomass monomers by cleavage, 
dehydration, decarboxylation and deamination [49]. Pro-
tein-derived compounds were represented by phenols, 
alkyl phenols, pyrrolidinone, indole and nitrile as a result 
of decomposition of the amino acids tyrosine and phe-
nylalanine found in Azolla [50]. Lipid-derived products 
included a range of long-chain saturated alkanes and fatty 
acids sized from C12 to C21: dodecane, tridecane, tetrade-
cane, pentadecane, hexadecane, heptadecane, octadecane, 
nonadecane, eicosane and heneicosane. A similar mixture 
of long-chain lipid-derived alkanes pyrolysis bio-liquid 
products was found in algae [51–56]. The main difference 
was that the pyrolysis of A. filiculoides showed accumula-
tion of phytol, 3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-ol, 
acyclic diterpene alcohol, as the product of the degradation 
of chlorophyll was the most abundant pyrolysis product.
Analysis of bio‑residue products
Figure 7 shows the FT-IR spectra of the Azolla feed and 
the bio-residues. The broad bands at 3200–3405 cm−1 are 
assigned to the stretching vibrations of hydrogen-bonded 
O–H groups and N–H groups and indicate the presence 
of polysaccharides, carbohydrates and proteins present in 
the Azolla feed. Initial Azolla feeds have strong stretch-
ing vibration peaks corresponding to the O–H and N–H 
groups, but that transmittance decreases in the bio-resi-
due. The peak at 1030 cm−1 disappeared in the bio-resi-
due. The peak around 1600–1620  cm−1 corresponding 
to the N–H bending vibration was present in Azolla feed 
and Azolla bio-residue. The peaks between 2800 and 
2930  cm−1 in the spectra of the residues became much 
weaker than those in the Azolla raw feed. The presence of 
a single peak at 1590 cm−1, attributed to the C=C stretch-
ing, indicates the formation of aromatic bio-char [57].
The X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD) spectra of 
A.filiculoides feed and bio-residues at different temperatures 
showed no significant differences in the powder X-ray dif-
fractogram (Additional file 8: Figure S3). The biomass feed 
and residue obtained at various temperatures showed typical 
amorphous nature indicating the structure of carbon in the 
residue is highly conjugated aromatic sheets cross-linked in 
a random manner. Morphological changes were apparent in 
the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the Azolla 
and bio-residue (Additional file 9: Figure S4). The images of 
the bio-residue obtained by hydrothermal liquefaction of the 
three Azolla bio-chars showed that the residue was spongy in 
nature, and there was no ordered porous structure.
Hydrogen production from acid‑treated Azolla biomass 
by Enterobacter cloacae DT‑1
Under heat-H2SO4 pre-treatment, A. filiculoides bio-
mass was hydrolyzed to different soluble reduced sugars 
mainly consisting of glucose (1.18 g/L), xylose (1.39 g/L) 
and arabinose (0.063  g/L). The acid-treated pre-hydro-
lysate used as feedstock for hydrogen production by 
Enterobacter cloacae (E. cloacae) in batch mode under 
decreased partial pressure pH2. pH2 significantly affects 
the hydrogen yield efficiency of fermentative hydrogen 
production by anaerobic bacteria since the hydrogen 
production pathways are sensitive to hydrogen concen-
tration leading to end product inhibition. It has been 
reported that high hydrogen partial pressure results in 
the production of more reduced products like ethanol 
and lactate instead of acetate, butyrate and H2. The batch 
fermenter was arranged to exert pressure on the head 
space of the fermenter which allowed the biogas to pass 
out of the head space immediately after its generation, 
thereby reducing the total partial pressure and thus the 
hydrogen partial pressure of the batch fermenter.
Fermentation with E. cloacae DT-1 led to the produc-
tion of 53 mmol/L hydrogen (Table 4). During fermenta-
tive hydrogen production, the final pH of the fermentation 
broth dropped from 7.5 to 5.42, which can be attributed to 
the production of short chain organic fatty acids [58, 59]. 
The total volatile fatty acid production was 1150  mg/L, 
largely composed of acetic acid (986  mg/L) and butyric 
acid (161 mg/L), with B/A ratio of 0.165. Hence the DT-1 
strain followed the mixed acid pathway and effectively uti-
lized the C5 sugars (xylose, arabinose and glucose) from 
the acid-treated prehydrolysate. Hydrogen yield efficiency 
was 2.43 mol of H2/mol of reducing sugar. As the maxi-
mum theoretical hydrogen yield efficiency from the dark 
fermentation route is 4 mol of H2/mol of glucose, approxi-
mately 60 % of the maximum possible hydrogen yield was 
obtained from the acid-treated biomass prehydrolysate. To 
the best of our knowledge, this is the first report for hydro-
gen production from A. filiculoides biomass sugars.

Hydrogen production from enzymatically treated Azolla 
biomass by E. cloacae DT‑1
Enzymatic hydrolysis of acid-treated A. filiculoides bio-
mass released glucose and xylose at a concentration of 
1.49 and 0.181 g/L, respectively. Around 34.8 mmol/L of 
volumetric hydrogen production (under decreased pH2) 
was obtained from the enzymatically hydrolyzed biomass 
sugars. The final pH of the fermentation broth dropped to 
5 during hydrogen production which was accompanied 
by the production of acetic acid (990 mg/L) and butyric 
acid (164 mg/L). Total VFA concentration was 1156 mg/L 
and the B/A ratio was 0.165 (Table 4). These results show 
that the mixed acid fermentation pathway was followed. 
The hydrogen yield efficiency was 2.04 mol of H2/mol of 
reducing sugar; therefore, it was lower than that obtained 
from the acid-treated prehydrolysate. Overall, hydrogen 
yield efficiency of the DT-1 strain from Azolla filiculoides 
biomass was 2.2 ± 2 mol/mol of reducing sugar. The effi-
ciency of hydrogen production from Azolla is similar to 
that obtained for terrestrial lignocellulosic feedstock which 
covers the range of 044–2.76  mol H2/mol sugars (Addi-
tional file 1: Table S1, Additional file 10: Table S6).
The carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio of biomass is 
important for efficient anaerobic digestion since micro-
organisms require significantly more C than N (C:N of 
25:1) for optimal hydrogen production. For this reason, 
the application of microalgae for hydrogen production is 
limited because they are rich in proteins and have a low 
C/N ratio (av. of 4) [60]. Co-fermentation with macro-
algae (such as Laminaria digitata), which are rich in 
carbohydrates with a high (C/N) ratio, improves the per-
formance of hydrogen production [60]. A. filiculoides 
contains 41 % total carbohydrates and 20 % proteins, as 
a result proximal analysis of biomass showed a C/N of 
15 (Additional file 6: Table S4) which is close to being an 
efficient feedstock for bio-hydrogen production.
Ethanol production from Azolla filiculoides and A. pinnata
Chemical analysis of A. filiculoides and A. pinnata bio-
masses is shown in Additional file  3: Table S2. A. fili-
culoides showed a high concentration of biomolecules 
which can be used as feedstock for production of 
bio-ethanol: starch (6.05 %), cellulose (21.8 %) and hemi-
cellulose (13.5 %). It has 10.3 % of lignin, which is higher 
than in duckweed and other aquatic plants but lower 
than in the main lignocellulosic bioenergy crops (Addi-
tional file 1: Table S1). Chemical analysis of A. pinnata 
showed a lower concentration of bio-ethanol-producing 
molecules: starch (4.7 %), cellulose (12.8 %) and hemicel-
lulose (10.1 %) and higher lignin content (up to 13.2 %).
The starch component of A. filiculoides and A. pin-
nata was enzymatically hydrolyzed by α-amylase and 
α-amyloglucosidase, and the cellulose/hemicellulose 
components were hydrolyzed by cellulase and cellobiase. 
The amounts of released glucose are shown in Table 5. As 
expected, the combination of four enzymes hydrolysing 
A. filiculoides biomass produced a higher amount of glu-
cose than for A. pinnata (up to 65.9 and 29.5 g/L, respec-
tively). This glucose yield was much higher than after 
treatment of the A. filiculoides biomass with a suspension 
of live Aspergillus niger grown on potato dextrose broth 
(2.5 g/L of glucose) shown by Pandey et al. [61].
After fermentation of reduced sugars with Saccharo-
myces cerevisiae the ethanol yields, YE/G (ethanol/glu-
cose, g/g) reflected the amount of released glucose in the 
samples, with yields of 0.56  g/g observed for A. filicu-
loides and 0.28 g/g for A. pinnata. The yield of 0.56 g/g 
is comparable to those reported from the fermentation 
of duckweed hydrolysates and some energy crops [62] 
(Additional file  1: Table S1). Interestingly, supplement-
ing the fermentation with additional nutrients showed no 
significant enhancement of the ethanol yield (not shown). 
This can be explained by the presence of the key nutrients 
for yeast growth in the biomass of both Azolla species.
The ethanol yield based on A. filiculoides biomass 
(YE/B) was determined as 0.09 g/g which is similar to the 
yield from S. cerevisiae ATCC 24859 grown on the duck-
weed L. minor which contained on average 10 % starch 
[62]. A higher ethanol yield, 0.19 g/g, was observed for 
Lemna aequinoctialis strain 6000 which has a fast growth 
rate and the ability to accumulate high levels of starch 
(up to 39 %) [63]. The potential of another duckweed rep-
resentative, Spirodela polyrrhiza, to increase its starch 
level under stress conditions up to 45.7 % together with

enzymatic hydrolysis with α-amylase, pullulanase and 
α-amyloglucosidase led to YE/B of 0.28 g/g [19, 20]. The 
chemical composition of the cell walls and lower starch 
accumulation was the likely reason for the lower ethanol 
yield from A. pinnata biomass (YE/B = 0.05 g/g). Utiliza-
tion of different yeast strains which can better ferment 
the spectrum of released sugars, and are more tolerant to 
the potential inhibitors, will be the next step in the opti-
mization of ethanol yield from Azolla biomass.
Azolla as universal feedstock for biofuel production
A systematic analysis of terrestrial plants for their 
potential to be ideal bioenergy crops led to a number of 
important selection criteria which include: (1) chemical 
composition and high proportion of biofuel-producing 
molecules; (2) high growth rates/biomass production; (3) 
high harvest index/rotation period; (4) ability to grow on 
marginal lands and lack of competition with agricultural 
crops for arable lands; (5) high freshwater use efficiency 
and low growing cost; (6) low harvest cost; and (7) pro-
duction of high value co-products [64]. These criteria 
have triggered an intensive search for domestication of 
the next generation of energy crops.
Azolla species together with their evolutional cyano-
bacterial symbiont, A. azollae, have attracted attention 
because of their potential to address all of the criteria men-
tioned above. Firstly, Azolla‘s biomass contains major types 
of energy molecules which include cellulose/hemicellulose, 
starch, and lipids resembling combinations of lignocellu-
losic, starch- and oil-producing terrestrial bioenergy crops 
and microalgae/cyanobacteria. Secondly, by doubling their 
biomass every 5–6 days and high annual productivity, they 
are one of the fastest growing plants, being second after 
microalgae for biomass production rates. Similar to micro-
algae their biomass production is not seasonal. Thirdly, 
Azolla can be grown efficiently outside of their natural 
habitat using wastewater as their main source of nutrients. 
Bioremediation of wastewaters can lead to absorption of 
up to 2.6 and 0.434 t/ha-year of total N and P, respectively 
[24, 25]. Azolla can also grow efficiently in N-depleted 
media assimilating up to 0.4 t N/ha-year nitrogen from the 
atmosphere through symbiosis with A. azollae. Fourthly, 
they are easy to harvest. And finally, Azolla species have 
been used for decades as nitrogen bio-fertilizers and live-
stock/fish feed (due to their high protein and carbohydrate 
levels). The lack of need to use synthetic nitrogen-based 
fertilizers for growing Azolla makes a substantial positive 
impact on the reduction of nitrous oxide (N2O) genera-
tion, the impact of which on warming the atmosphere is 
almost 300 times that of carbon dioxide [65].
Thermochemical technologies
Azolla biomass was used as feedstock for production of 
bio-oil, bio-char and biogas using two thermochemical 
technologies, pyrolysis [24] and HTL (this work). Given 
the high annual productivity of Azolla, this leads to the 
theoretical production of pyrolysis- and HTL-based bio-
oils valued as up to 13.2 and 20.2 t/ha-year, respectively. 
Both bio-oils contain a range of petrochemicals which 
can be directly used as glycerin-free components of bio-
diesel or can be upgraded to biofuels using some well-
established technologies [24]. Both thermochemical

technologies can also produce bio-solids, such as bio-
char and ash (up to 48 t/ha-year for both), which can 
be used to improve soil quality by increasing their nutri-
ent- and moisture-holding capacity, support microbial 
communities and promote the root activity [66]. Ash 
from Azolla contains alkali elements (Li, Na, K, Mg, Ca) 
as well as microelements such as Fe, Mn and Cu making 
it a good candidate for use as fertilizer [24, 67].
Biodiesel production
Growing on wastewaters, the annual theoretical yield 
of crude lipids from A. filiculoides can be estimated as 
1.68 t/ha-year. This amount can be increased to 8 t/ha-
year if the plant will grow under natural conditions with 
productivity around 100  t dw/ha-year. This oil produc-
tivity is significantly higher than from soybean (0.44  t/
ha-year), sunflower (0.78  t/ha-year), rapeseed (1.17  t/
ha-year) and oil palm (6.0 t/ha-year), but lower than the 
theoretical yield from microalgae (up to 73  t/ha-year, 
for Nannochloropsis sp.) [28, 29, 68]. As Azolla/A. azol-
lae contain a range of C16:0, C18:2 and C18:3 fatty acids, 
their conversion to methyl esters means that the resultant 
biodiesel meets the crucial requirements of fuel density, 
cetane number and iodine value for biodiesel set by the 
EN14214 standard [28].
Ethanol production
The theoretical ethanol production from A. filiculoides 
is 9.3 t/ha-year (11.7 × 103 L/ha/year, based on specific 
volume of ethanol  =  0.789  g/mL) which is lower than 
ethanol production from sugarcane (25 × 103 L/ha-year), 
close to that from corn stover (13.31 × 103 L/ha-year), 
but higher than from miscanthus (2.3 × 103 L/ha-year), 
willow (0.3 × 103 L/ha-year) and poplar (1.3 × 103 L/ha-
year) (Additional file 1: Table S1).
Bio‑hydrogen production
The high biomass production yield, chemical composition 
(C/N ratio) and high bio-hydrogen yield of 2.2 mol/mol 
substrate make Azolla a competitive feedstock for hydro-
gen production compared with other bioenergy crops 
(Additional file 1: Table S1, Additional file 10: Table S6).
Conclusions
The chemical composition of Azolla’s biomass contains 
a unique combination of bioenergy molecules found in 
lignocellulosic, starch- and oil-producing terrestrial bio-
energy crops, microalgal and cyanobacterial species. 
Ability to grow on wastewaters and high growth and 
productivity rates makes Azolla species a most attractive 
feedstock for low cost, low energy demanding, near zero 
maintenance system for production of a wide spectrum 
of biofuels.
Methods
Growing Azolla
Azolla filiculoides and Azolla pinnata were from RMIT 
University’s collection of aquatic plants. The plants were 
collected, rinsed in deionized water and any unwanted 
debris removed. Experiments were carried out in plastic 
containers (500 mL) filled with 100 and 50 % of the sele-
nium-supplemented synthetic wastewater (SeSW) (Addi-
tional file 4: Table S3). The containers were initially seeded 
with the same amount of fresh A. filiculoides, sufficient to 
cover the entire water surface with a single layer of fronds. 
The containers were placed in a 23 °C growth chamber with 
16 h photoperiod and a photosynthetic photon flux density 
of 50 µmol/m2/s. The solution in each container was mixed 
every day. Three replicates were included for each treat-
ment. Destructive sampling was conducted to evaluate the 
Se, ammonia, nitrate and phosphate contents every day over 
5 days. Solution samples were analysed for ammonia cati-
ons, nitrate and phosphate anions and pH. Concentrations 
of cations and anions were measured using the ion chro-
matography system Dionex ICS-1100 (Thermo Scientific, 
USA). The dry weights were determined immediately after 
sampling by drying samples at 80  °C overnight. Growth 
was monitored by from fresh weight using the following 
equation: µ = (ln Ntn −ln Nt0)

(tn −t0), where Ntn was 
the fresh weight and Nt0 was the fresh weight at day 0. The 
chemical composition of Azolla biomass was analysed by 
near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS). Starch was 
analysed by starch (HK) assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich, USA).
Selenium extraction and measurements
SeSW samples were collected at the beginning and at the 
end of the experimental period, acidified with concen-
trated HNO3 to pH 2 and kept at 4 °C. Plants from each 
treatment were rinsed with Milli-Q water, blotted on 
filter paper and dried at 70 °C overnight. Dried samples 
were then ground using a mortar and pestle and aliquots 
(100 mg) were weighed into glass tubes and digested with 
HNO3 (68.5 %):HClO4 (70 %) mixture (1 mL, 10:1, v/v) 
in a dry heating block at 100 °C for 30 min [69]. After 
cooling to room temperature, samples were filtered 
(Whatman number 42, 11  cm) and diluted to 10  mL 
with Milli-Q water. Plant extracts and wastewater were 
analysed for total selenium concentration by inductively 
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Agilent 
Technologies, Model 4500 series 300).
Shrimp toxicity test
Adult freshwater glass shrimp, Paratya australiensis, from 
RMIT’s collection were used. The shrimps were accli-
matized over 2  weeks before commencing the toxicity 
tests. They were maintained in 20-L glass tanks contain-
ing dechlorinated filtered water at 24  °C, with a 16:8  h 

Page 13 of 17
Miranda et al. Biotechnol Biofuels  (2016) 9:221 
light:dark photoperiod and a light intensity of 400 to 600 lx. 
The shrimps were fed daily with algae wafers and trout pel-
lets. However, they were not fed for 24 h before the com-
mencement of the tests. The toxicity tests were performed 
under static conditions in 500-mL glass beakers over 96 h. 
The LC50 was calculated for each treatment using a Pro-
bit analysis. All the statistical tests were analysed using a 
ToxRat 3Software (ToxRat Solutions GmbH).
Ethanol production
Enzymatic treatment of Azolla
The samples of A. filiculoides and A. pinnata which had 
been washed in MilliQ water was dried in a hot air oven 
at 70 °C overnight and then ground. For de-lignification, 
the sample (5  g) was mixed with 25  mM NaOAc (pH 
5.5) and autoclaved at 121 °C, 15 lbs, for 20 min. Enzy-
matic saccharification was performed according to [62]. 
In brief, 500 µL of a-amylase (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and 
50  µL α-amyloglucosidase (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) were 
added per gram of dry biomass and incubated at 37  °C 
with shaking at 250 rpm for 5 h. For the second step, the 
pH was adjusted to 4.8, and 200 µL of cellulase (Sigma-
Aldrich, USA) and 70 µL of glucosidase (Cellobiase) from 
Aspergillus niger (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) per gram of dry 
biomass were added. The suspension was shaken at 50 °C 
for 24 h. Glucose released was determined with a glucose 
assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich, USA).
Ethanol fermentation
Saccharomyces cerevisiae was grown from a slope cul-
ture by inoculation into 200  mL of Difco™ Yeast and 
Mould (YM) broth 0.3 % (w/v) yeast extract, 0.3 % (w/v) 
malt extract, 0.5 % (w/v) peptone and 1 % (w/v) dextrose. 
The yeast was grown in this medium for 3 days at 25 °C. 
Before inoculation of the hydrolysate, the yeast was cen-
trifuged (3000  rpm, 3  min) and then resuspended in 
growth media. Ethanol fermentations were carried out 
by S. cerevisiae (1.0 × 107 cells/mL) added to 500 µL of 
each hydrolysate with and without additional nutrients 
(0.5 g/L yeast extract and 0.5 g/L peptone) and fermented 
at 28 °C and 150 rpm for 48 h. Then samples were trans-
ferred to screw-cap tubes and were heated at 100 °C for 
5 min to terminate the fermentation. Samples were cen-
trifuged, and the supernatants were assessed for ethanol 
by gas chromatography.
Bio‑hydrogen production
Microorganism, media and growth condition
Enterobacter cloacae DT-1 (Gene Bank accession num-
ber: JX885522) isolated previously was employed [58]. 
This strain was routinely maintained anaerobically in 
BSH medium. BSH medium was composed of (g/L): 
peptone; 2, yeast extract; 1, NaCl2; 2, K2HPO4; 0.230, 
KH2PO4; 4.035, 4  mL (4×) of trace solution and 4  mL 
(4×) of vitamin solution. Trace element solution was 
composed of (g/L) MnO4.7H2O; 0.01, ZnSO4.7H2O; 
0.05, H3BO3; 0.01, N(CH2COOH)3; 4.5, CaCl2.2H20; 0.01, 
Na2MoO4; 0.01, CoCl2.6H2O; 0.01, MgCl2.6H2O; 00.2, 
FeCl3; 0.1, CuCl2.6H2O; 0.05. Vitamin solution was com-
posed of (g/L); riboflavin; 0.025, citric acid; 0.02, folic 
acid; 0.01, and para-amino benzoic acid, 0.01. The pH 
of the BSH medium was adjusted to 7.5 and incubation 
temperature was set at the optimum of 37 °C.
Acid pre‑treatment of Azolla filiculoides biomass
Ten grams of dried A. filiculoides biomass sample was 
hydrolysed in 1  % sulphuric acid by autoclaving for 
60  min at 120  °C. The hydrolysed biomass was centri-
fuged at 10,000  rpm for 10  min, and the supernatant 
(designated as acid-treated prehydrolysate) was sepa-
rated. The pre-treated solid biomass was processed for 
enzymatic treatment to obtain the hydrolyzed sugars. 
The acid-treated prehydrolysate of the A. filiculoides 
biomass sample was analysed for reduced sugar concen-
tration and employed further to use as feedstock for bio-
hydrogen production by E. cloacae DT-1.
Enzymatic saccharification of Azolla filiculoides biomass
The pre-treated A. filiculoides biomass pellet was pro-
cessed for enzymatic hydrolysis for its conversion to 
reducing sugars. The pre-treated A. filiculoides biomass 
sample was acidified with RO water; the pH was reduced 
to 5 and enzymatic treatment was conducted at 50  °C 
for 24  h by adding the enzyme cellulase. The hydro-
lyzed sample was analysed for the concentration of sugar 
before use as feedstock for dark fermentative bio-hydro-
gen production by E. cloacae DT-1.
Batch dark fermentation experiments
Laboratory-scale batch fermentative hydrogen produc-
tion studies were conducted in 2000  mL serum bottles 
(batch reactors) containing 160 mL of anaerobically pre-
pared BSH medium [59, 70] supplemented separately 
with acid-treated prehydrolysate (50  % v/v, 11  g/L of 
reducing sugars) and enzymatically hydrolyzed sug-
ars (33 % v/v, 4.8 g/L reducing sugar) as feedstock. The 
initial pH of the media was maintained at 7.5, and 10 % 
(v/v) freshly grown DT-1 culture was used as inoculum. 
The bottles were incubated at 37 °C for 72 h under static 
conditions. Biogas generated during the fermentation 
process was collected under decreased partial pressure of 
H2 (by reducing the total pressure of biogas in the head 
space of the fermenter). This entailed using a water dis-
placement system involving an inverted water-filled bot-
tle to exert pressure on the head space of the fermenter 
which allowed displacement of the biogas immediately 

Page 14 of 17
Miranda et al. Biotechnol Biofuels  (2016) 9:221 
after its generation within the batch fermenter. Volumet-
ric biogas production was monitored by measuring the 
displaced water collected in a graduated inverted water 
displacement system containing saline solution at ambi-
ent temperature. All experiments were performed in 
duplicate. Qualitative detection of hydrogen was done by 
gas chromatography.
Analytical methods
The composition of the biogas generated in the head 
space during the dark fermentation process was ana-
lysed by gas chromatography (7890A, Agilent Technolo-
gies, USA) by following the protocols of Subudhi et  al. 
[58]. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC, 
Agilent 1100 series, USA) using a Sugar-PAK.1 column 
(Water Research, USA) was used for the detection of etha-
nol. Water was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 
0.6 mL/min. All the analyses were performed in duplicate. 
Sugar concentrations were measured by the DNS method.
Hydrothermal liquefaction
Hydrothermal liquefaction experiments were conducted 
in a 100-mL high-pressure autoclave (Parr reactor) made 
of hastelloy at different reaction conditions of temperature 
and residence time. In a typical hydrothermal liquefaction 
experiment, the reactor was loaded with A. filiculoides 
and water as a solvent (1:6 by weight). The reactor was 
purged five times with nitrogen to remove the air. Reac-
tants were agitated with a stirrer (~200 rpm). The temper-
ature was then raised to the desired value and maintained 
at that level for 15 min. The pressure during the process 
was autogenous, with maximum pressure in the range of 
60–83 bar under the different reaction conditions. After 
the reaction, the procedure for separation of bio-oil1, bio-
residue and bio-oil2 was as given in [40]. The experiments 
were repeated several times and the deviation of the liquid 
yields was within 1 %. The equations used to calculate the 
yield of various fractions were as follows:
Conversion (%) = W1 −W2
W1
× 100
Bio-oil yield (wt%) = Wether soluble
W1
× 100
Bio-oil2yield (wt%) = Wacetone soluble
W1
× 100
Solid residue yield (wt%) = Wsolid
W1
× 100
Gas yield (wt%) = W(vessel + feed + water) before HTU −W(vessel + feed + water ) after HTU
Amount of feed taken (g) + amount of water added (g)
× 100
where W1 is the weight of Azolla feed; W2 is the weight of 
bio-residue; W ether soluble is the weight of ether-soluble 
bio-oil (bio-oil1); and W acetone soluble is the weight of 
acetone soluble bio-oil (bio-oil2). All yields were calcu-
lated by dry material.
TG-DTG of A. filiculoides was carried out on a Shi-
madzu DTG-60 under N2 flow. The elemental analysis 
was conducted in an Elementar Vario micro cube unit. 
Moisture content was obtained using an HR-83 Met-
tler Toledo Halogen Moisture Analyzer. The 1H NMR 
spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 500 Plus 
instrument using CDCl3 as a solvent. X-ray diffraction 
patterns of sample powders were collected by a Bruker 
D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer fitted with a Lynx eye 
high-speed strip detector and a Cu Kα radiation source. 
Diffraction patterns in the 2°–80° region were recorded 
with a 0.04 step size (step time = 4 s). The FT-IR spec-
tra were recorded on a Nicolet 8700 FTIR spectrometer 
with the sample powder diluted in KBr. SEM images 
were obtained with an FEI Quanta 200 F using a tung-
sten filament doped with lanthanum hexaboride (LaB6) 
as an X-ray source, fitted with an ETD (Everhart–Thorn-
ley detector), which preferentially worked as a secondary 
electron detector.
The samples for SEM were dispersed on an adhesive-
coated carbon paper and then were gold coated.
The organic fraction of the bio-oil was analysed 
using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/
MS, Agilent 7890B). The carrier gas was He, and col-
umn flow rate was one mL  min−1. An HP-1 column 
(25 m × 0.32 mm × 0.17 µm) was used for the separa-
tion. The oven was set at 50 °C for 2 min, followed by a 
heating rate of 5 °C min−1–280 °C at which it was held for 
5 min. The injected volume was 0.4 µL in splitless mode.
TOC analysis of feed and bio-char was performed 
using a Shimadzu TOC-L unit with solid sample mod-
ule SSM-5000A. The volatile matter was calculated by 
measuring the weight loss in the sample after placing it 
in a muffle furnace at 950 °C for 2 min, similar to ASTM 
D3175. Volatile matter and ash analysis of the feed was 
carried out using oven dried feedstock.
