was used as check material for comparison. Significant differ-
ences between the provenances (P < 0.05) were observed for
height, diameter at breast height (DBH), number of branches
and field survival. The provenances from Gujrat (Punjab), Pak-
istan, ranked first for growth traits namely height, DBH and
survival. The next superior provenance was from Beihan,
Yemen, which scored second highest values of height and DBH

genetic differences exist between the provenances of A.nilotica.
None of the traits assessed (viz. height, DBH, number of
branches, inter-nodal length and survival) were found to corre-
late with any of the geographical coordinates of the prove-
nances (latitude, longitude and altitude). Height, DBH and
number of branches showed significant and positive correlation
with each other. Fair differences between phenotypic and geno-
typic coefficient of variability were observed. Heritability val-
ues were found fairly good for height, DBH and number of
branches as compared to inter-nodal length. The relative per-
formance of these provenances was fairly consistent through-
out the period of observation at three and six year. The two
sources viz. Gujrat (Punjab), Pakistan and Beihan, Yemen, are
recommended for plantation programme under semi-arid con-
ditions.

Introduction
Acacia nilotica Willd. ex Del. is a fast growing multipurpose
tree species of India that provides high quality wood and other
products (ANON., 1980). It is recognized into nine subspecies or
varieties and is a very variable species with a natural distribu-
tion covering large tracts of tropical and subtropical Africa and
Asia (BRENAN, 1983; ROSS, 1979). In India, it occurs extensively
on a wide strip from north to south of the country under varied
ecological conditions, though it is widely planted in afforesta-
tion programmes in the plains of arid and semi-arid regions.
Farmers with small holding value this leguminous species by
virtue of its nitrogen fixing ability and improving the fertility
of soil, good coppicing ability, green manure, providing fodder,
fuel, timber to some extent and excellent characteristics as an
agroforestry tree species (VISHWANATH and KAUSHIK, 1993). It is
also a most sought after species for afforestation program in
controlling the shifting sand dunes, coastal sands, river beds,
saline lands, dry and degraded lands and waste lands where
rainfall is scanty and erratic.
In India, A. nilotica though occurs naturally in extensive
areas but due to a long history of selective felling and biotic
interference has resulted it in small discrete populations that
appear degraded. These dwindling natural populations are the
basic material for future breeding and are the only source
material for bringing improvement in future plantations.
Hence a comprehensive exploration and mapping of natural
populations, which are disappearing fast needed to be under-
taken (GINWAL and GERA, 2000). 
The significance of genetic variation studies and provenance
testing in forest tree improvement is very well realized (PRYOR,
1963; CALLAHAM, 1964; WRIGHT, 1976). Exploration of naturally

existing variability offers scope to tree breeder for making
rapid genetic advance at relatively low cost in terms of energy
and finance. The form and growth of A. nilotica varies consid-
erably in different provenances (SHIVKUMAR and BANERJEE,
1986; KRISHAN and TOKY, 1995). Considerable seed source and
provenance difference in A. nilotica have been reported in seed,
seedling characteristics and early growth performance in many
recent studies conducted in India (GINWAL et al., 1994, 1995,
1996; MATHUR et al., 1984; SHIVKUMAR and BANERJEE, 1986;
BAGCHI et al., 1990; BAGCHI and DOBRIYAL, 1990). However,
information on field performance of the provenances is little
(SHIVKUMAR and BANERJEE, 1986; KRISHAN and TOKY, 1995),
that too on provenances emanating from wide geographical
zones.
The apparent high phenotypic variability between the popu-
lations (SHIVKUMAR and BANERJEE, 1986; GINWAL et al., 1995,
1996; KRISHAN and TOKY, 1995) in seed and seedling character-
istics of A. nilotica warrants for evaluating provenances in field
for achieving the economic benefits through selection. The pre-
sent investigation was undertaken to find out the pattern and
magnitude of genetic variation in growth characteristics of 20
A. nilotica provenances of wide geographical origin represent-
ing five countries viz. India, Sudan, Senegal, Pakistan and
Yemen. The objective was to identify the best provenance based
on growth and adaptability, which could be utilized for refor-
estation work for enhancement in productivity of the planta-
tions and also in genetic improvement programme. 
Material and Methods
The study was conducted in the experimental area of Tropi-
cal Forest Research Institute, Jabalpur (situated between 23°
5’ 07’’ to 23° 6’ 10’’ N lat. and 79° 59’ 49’’ to 79° 59’ 42’’ E. long.,
400 meter altitude), India. The area enjoys semi-arid type of
climate with mean annual rainfall 1350 mm. The soil of the
experimental area is well drained, clay loam with shallow
depth (25–50 cm) and contains slight surface stoniness (3–5%).
Seeds of 19 different provenances were received through
DANIDA Forest Seed Center, Denmark, during 1992 (Table 1).
The local population from State Forest Research Institute
(S.F.R.I.), Jabalpur was used as check material (local control).
Seeds were pretreated with boiled water for 5 minutes prior to
sowing. 400 seeds of each of the 19 provenances along with con-
trol (check material) were directly sown in polythene bags (20 x
40 cm size with one seed per bag) containing potting mixture of
sand, soil and farm yard manure in the ratio of 1:1:1 (by vol-
ume). The polythene bags were placed in nursery on a poly-
thene sheet in randomized complete block design with 4 repli-
cations in an open ground and watered daily. The germination
of the seeds was recorded and the seedlings were maintained in
the nursery till they attained a plantable height.
Four-month-old seedlings were planted in the field (pit size
60 x 60 x 60 cm) in August 1993 in a randomized complete
block design with 4 replications. Each provenance constituted a
square plot with 25 trees (5 x 5) at the spacing of 3 x 3 m
between plants. Nine central trees in each plot constituted the
measuring unit. The assessment of the trial for various traits
viz. plant height (m), diameter at breast height (cm), number of
branches, inter-nodal length and survival per cent was made
on yearly basis in September every year. In this paper the
growth data recorded in September 1996 and 1999 have been
reported and described. 
The data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) for
confirming the differences between the provenances and fur-
ther analyzed for Least Significant Difference (LSD), test for
checking the homogeneity between the provenances using
SPSS (Version 6.1) computer program (SPSS Inc. 233 S. Wack-
er Drive, 11th floor, Chicago, IL 60606-6307). Coefficient of vari-
ation (CV%) and linear correlation coefficient among the stud-
ied traits and with latitude, longitude and altitude of seed ori-
gin of the provenances were calculated as described by
SNEDECOR and COCHRAN (1967). Genotypic and phenotypic vari-
ances and their coefficient of variation and heritability were
calculated using the method of KEMPTHORNE (1957).

Results
The provenances under the trial belongs to two African sub-
species viz. nilotica and tomentosa and two Indian varieties viz.
subsp. indica var. cupressiformis and subsp. indica var. jaque-
montii. However, no apparent pattern of differences was
observed between the different subspecies included in the trial.
Data on field growth (three and six years) in respect of mor-
phological traits viz. height, diameter at breast height (DBH),
number of branches, inter-nodal length and survival percent-
age pertaining to 20 provenances are presented in Table 2.
Variation between the provenances in growth traits at the age
of three years was found significant (P < 0.05) except for sur-
vival per cent. The provenance S16 attained a maximum
height, followed by S17, S5, and S15, which were statistically
at par with each other. These provenances performed better
than the local (control) seed source S20. Similarly maximum
diameter (DBH) was registered in S16 followed by S17, and S1.
These were also statistically at par in performance. The S9
provenance resulted in the minimum height and DBH. The S5
provenance was found to be the most-branchy one, however it
was at par with S17, S16, S2, S19, S13, S10 and S6. Field sur-
vival was recorded maximum in S16, which was closely fol-
lowed by S14, S7 and S6. The minimum survival was observed
in S13 provenance. The range of variation was considerably
good in respect of the traits studied as evident from the values
of coefficient of variation. Over all, the performance of S16, S17
and S5 provenances was found better than others.
A clear-cut distinction in the performance of the provenances
was observed at age six years (Table 2) wherein the S16 prove-
nance out ranked the rest. Though maximum height growth
was shown by S16 at this age, but was statistically at par with
other 11 provenances viz. S17, S13, S15, S5, S1, S2, S19, S14,
S10, S6 and S3. The S9 provenance registered the minimum
height, but was at par with S18, S8, S20 and S12. The local
seed source S20 performed very poor and ranked fourth-last in
respect of height growth. A similar pattern in DBH was
observed wherein S16 put maximum diameter followed by S17
and S19. However, these three provenances were observed sta-
tistically at par in respect of DBH. The lowest DBH was
recorded in S9 provenance. The S5 provenance maintained its
superiority even at age six years and produced maximum num-
ber of branches. However, it was at par with S17, S16, S2, S13,
S19, S6 and S10 for this trait. The S8 source showed the lowest
number of branches. The inter-nodal length was recorded max-
imum in S2 and minimum in S7. No significant differences
were observed between the provenances for inter-nodal length.
The S16 provenance also registered its superiority with a fair
margin in respect of survival per cent (88.9%). The per cent
survival in local seed source S20 was 61.1%. The lowest sur-
vival (35.3%) was however recorded in S12. The coefficient of
variation for height, DBH, number of branches, inter-nodal
length and field survival was found to be 7.31, 6.63, 11.21, 2.57
and 19.17 per cent respectively.
Based on the performance of provenances at age three and
six years, the fastest growth was recorded in S16 thus making
it most promising in comparison to other sources. The perfor-
mance of this provenance remained consistent throughout the
observation period of three and six years age. The local control
S20 did not perform well during the period of observation and
stood far behind many provenances with a fair margin particu-
larly in height, DBH and survival.
The correlation coefficient (r) among the various traits across
the age is presented in Table 3. Height was found to have high-
er significant positive relationship (P < 0.01) with DBH and
number of branches at age three and six years. DBH was found
to have significant positive relationship (P < 0.01) with number
of branches at both observation periods. Height, DBH and
number of branches at age three years were found significantly
and positively correlated with height, DBH and number of
branches at six age years. Field survival of both the observa-
tion periods showed inter-correlation significantly and positive-
ly with each other. 
Variance components and broad sense heritability for growth
traits at age six years are presented in Table 4. There were fair
differences between the values of genotypic and phenotypic
variance and genotypic and phenotypic co-efficient of variation
for all the characters. Estimates of heritability (%) of growth
traits were moderate to high which ranged from 5.46 to
39.42%. High heritability was obtained for number of branch-
es, height and DBH, however the values for the same were low
in respect of inter-nodal length. 
Discussion
A. nilotica is a very variable species in habit and morphology
which evidenced in nine subspecies, and this is reflected in the
manner in which their prime use varies depending on the

region (RAEBILD et al., 2003). The two African subspecies
included in this trial, nilotica and tomentosa differ in their eco-
logical requirements (VON MAYDELL, 1986; ROSS, 1979; FAGG
and BARNES, 1990). Indian subspecies indica is naturally river-
ine forming low altitude dry forests but it has come to be wide-
ly planted as a farm tree on the plains throughout the subcon-
tinent (RAEBILD et al., 2003). One reason of large variability
may be the existence of subspecies in provenances, which may
show variability in morphology and growth due to differences
in their different ecological requirements. The differences in
growth and adaptability are largely of geographic origin and
are of genetic nature. It is mainly due to the fact that the
provenances originated over a wide range of rainfall, tempera-
ture and soil types in Africa and Asia and might have experi-
enced marked differences in selective pressure. 
Height and diameter are considered as the most important
parameters in the evaluation of species and provenances. Apart
from indicating productivity and volume they may also be seen
as a measure of the adaptability of trees to the environment,
tall provenances/trees usually being better adapted to the site
than small provenances/trees (RAEBILD et al., 2003). Result of
this trial indicates that the provenances of countries other than
India particularly Pakistan and Yemen are better performing
under the Jabalpur (M.P.) conditions. The provenances from
Gujrat (Punjab), Pakistan had by far the best performance, and
the growth of provenances from India was moderately good.
The local source could not perform well and lagged behind with
a fair margin. No explanatory reason for the poor performance
of the local source can be given at this stage however, it
appears that many of the provenances originated from areas
having lesser precipitation than that at Jabalpur (M.P.) India.
They are expected to develop better adaptability characters
than those provenances, which emanate from higher rain-fed
areas. The reason for better growth performance of majority of
Pakistan provenances in India could be attributed to the mon-
soon rainfall in July, August and September months in both the
countries. Many Indian provenances also perform well with
respect to the height and diameter of the trees viz. S5 from
Nizamabad (A.P.), S6 from Azamgarh (U.P.), S19 from Mahen-
dergarh (Haryana) and S10 from Maratwara (Maharashtra). 
Survival of plants indicates the adaptability of the prove-
nance to the environment at the trial site. There was a large
variation in the survival, ranging from 35.3 to 88.9%. Among
the provenances from India, Sudan, Senegal, Pakistan and
Yemen, only the provenance of Gujrat (Punjab), Pakistan had a
survival approaching 90%. The provenances from Sudan had
comparatively better survival (above 70%) than the prove-
nances from Senegal and Pakistan. Indian provenances viz. S6
from Ajamgarh (U.P.), S7 from Salem (Tamilnadu), S9 from
Pune (Maharashtra) and S10 from Marathwara (Maharashtra)
also performed well in survival per cent. The better survival in
Sudanese provenances has also been reported by RAEBILD et al.
(2003). Sudanese provenances are expected to have better
adaptation mechanism to dryer and harsh conditions and
therefore may have shown better survival under semi-arid test
conditions. Comparing the origin of the provenances with the
conditions of the site no clear picture emerges. One would be
interested to expect that a match between climate at the origin
and climate at the test site, but the data do not clearly support
this.
The local seed source in the present study ranked very low in
comparison to others, which is an indication that there is a
good scope of selection of promising genotypes from the study
material and introduction of germplasm of superior prove-
nances from Pakistan, Yemen and other African countries for
the enhancement of productivity. The extent of variability in
the base population is measured by different population para-
meters including genotypic and phenotypic variations and
genotypic and phenotypic co-efficient of variation (SUBRAMAN-
IAN et al., 1995). In the present study there were considerable
differences between the values of genotypic and phenotypic co-
efficient of variation for all the characters. This indicates that
these characters are sensitive to environmental changes (SUB-
RAMANIAN et al., 1995). The genotypic co-efficient of variation is
comparatively low than the phenotypic coefficient of variation
for all the studied traits. The heritability values for the studied
traits were fairly good for height, diameter and number of
branches. High heritabilities in conjunction with high genetic
coefficient of variation (GCV) have been reported to be advan-
tageous for practicing selection (HANSON et al., 1956; BAGCHI et
al., 1990). Further, the significant provenance difference cou-
pled with lower error variance signifies heritability for these
traits. Heritability in broad sense may give useful indication
about the relative value of selection in material in hand and
hence an effective selection may bring improvement in those
traits.
In view of high heritability for height, diameter, number of
branches and their significant positive inter-relationship at age
6 years, indicate that possible simultaneous improvement
could be obtained while selecting for one or the other trait.
Such relationships may be used to the advantage of the breeder
for the improvement of these traits. Variation for all the stud-
ied traits was observed non-clinal type as none of the studied
trait was found to bear any significant correlation with any of
the geographic coordinates i.e. latitude, longitude and altitude.
It would not be justified to draw a conclusion that the Indian
provenances cannot perform better than the provenances of
Pakistan and Yemen until and unless more provenances of
Indian origin are studied for their performance as A. nilotica
has wide distribution range in India. However, the results of
this study can be applied in taking decision of development of
new breeding populations of selected sources of Pakistan and
Yemen. Further the existence of significant differences among
twenty provenances of A. nilotica, for growth performance at
age 6 years in field, provides a firm base for establishment of
wide-range provenance test; using more evenly distributed pop-
ulations from the whole range of the species. The two prove-
nances, which ranked high on the basis of growth and survival
viz. Gujrat (Punjab), Pakistan and Beihan, Yemen, can be con-
sidered for large scale planting programme at Jabalpur (M.P.)
site and nearby area under semi-arid conditions. The perfor-
mance of these two provenances was consistent across the age.
Among the Indian provenances the choice remains between
provenance from Nizamabad (A.P.), Azamgarh (U.P.), Mahen-
dergarh (Haryana) and Maratwara (Maharashtra). The work
further gives a direction to effect and practice selection and ini-
tiate studies for genetic improvement of this species.

Abstract
The genotypic and phenotypic correlation and path analysis
of plant biomass, plant height, stem diameter and other bio-
mass component traits were analyzed in thirty provenances of
Bombax ceiba. In general, the magnitude of genotypic correla-
tions was higher than phenotypic correlations. Stem diameter
and plant biomass showed highly significant genotypic correla-
tions with all the traits except the number of secondary
branches and plant biomass with leaf biomass. Plant height
had the highest positive direct effect on plant biomass followed
by the number of primary branches/plant and the number of
leaves/plant. On the basis of this study, a higher plant biomass
would be achieved through direct selection based on plant
height, the number of primary branches and the number of
leaves/plant. Therefore, the study is important in selection of
traits of economic importance based on other characters, whose
direct effect is not visible.
Key words: Bombax ceiba L., provenance, plant biomass, biomass char-
acters, genotypic and phenotypic correlation, path coefficient.
