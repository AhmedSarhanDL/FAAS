Abstract: Water resources management is a vital need in arid and semi-arid regions such as Sinai
Peninsula, Egypt. Accordingly, the sustainability of water resources in this arid environment should
be examined in terms of the possibility of groundwater recharge, particularly through runoff water,
while identifying the most appropriate potential sites for drilling new water wells to cover current
and future needs. The aquifer system of El-Qaa Plain in South Sinai is considered one of the structural
basins associated with the tectonic setting of the Gulf of Suez. It is the main source of high-quality
water in South Sinai. The present work provided an integration of mathematical ﬂow modeling,
hydrochemical composition, environmental isotopic signature, watershed modeling system (WMS),
and remote sensing (RS) tools to determine the aquifer sustainability and recharge mechanisms.
The obtained results indicated the following: (a) the salinity of the water ranged between 326.4 and
2261 ppm, while the environmental isotope values ranged between −6.28 to −4.48‰ for δ18O and
−29.87 to −21.7‰ for δ2H, which reveals the phase of recharge and mixing between ancient water
and recent rainwater; (b) sites for three dams in three sub-watersheds were proposed to harvest
approximately 790,000 m3/y of runoff water to enhance groundwater recharge of the aquifer system;
(c) and ﬁve scenarios using MODFLOW indicated that water drawdown is acceptable by adding
10 new production wells (discharge rate increased by 3600 m3/day). Moreover, increasing the
recharge rate by 2% from the base case, leads to an increase in the piezometric water level with an
average value of 0.13 masl, which reﬂects the positive effects of the proposed runoff water harvesting
facilities. The integration applied in this work represents an integrated management system for water
resources (surface and groundwater) which is suitable for application in arid or semi-arid coastal and
similar areas.

1. Introduction
Water scarcity is a global issue, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. Consequently,
sustainable management of water resources can be maintained by maximizing the utiliza-
tion of surface water and groundwater in these regions [1]. The global documentation of
groundwater depletion compared with the natural renewal and the supply need to support
ecosystems, led to a vital need to study the possibility of enhancing recharge possibili-
ties [2]. Overpopulation, high urbanization, anthropogenic activities, and unplanned use of

groundwater are the main factors for water shortage [3,4]. Management and sustainability
of groundwater resources under variable hydrogeological conditions are studied globally
by many researchers (i.e., [5–9]). Located in the arid and semi-arid belt of Egypt, the Sinai
Peninsula is increasingly suffering from scarcity of water resources. Sinai Peninsula is
one of the important developmental areas of Egypt. It is one of the target areas of the
Egyptian national development plan 2023. Consequently, additional fresh water quantities
are required to fulﬁll the needs of these developmental activities. Therefore, the water
resources in the Sinai Peninsula require updated plans to sustain and conserve fresh water
for various purposes [10]. The groundwater reserves in the Peninsula are limited and are
represented by the Miocene–Quaternary sediments, Eocene ﬁssured limestones, Meso-
zoic Jurassic and Cretaceous sandstones, Paleozoic sandstones, and crystalline fractured
basement rocks [11]. These aquifers are distributed in different parts of the peninsula, in
different watersheds, and at coastal areas. Hundreds of groundwater wells were drilled
in these aquifers at shallow and deep depths. These aquifers provide many parts of the
Peninsula with fresh water for drinking and agricultural purposes [11]. The management of
the aquifer in terms of improving the recharge mechanism and controlling the withdrawal
scenarios has become an urgent need for the development of the aquifer, keeping pace
with the requirements and overcoming the problem of water scarcity. The coastal aquifer in
El-Qaa Plain region is considered one of most promising groundwater units in South Sinai
(Figure 1). It supplies fresh water to many cities in South Sinai, in addition to irrigation wa-
ter for many modern agricultural activities. The El-Qaa Plain area is considered a vital area
in South Sinai suitable for agricultural development, yet it is frequently exposed to natural
hazards, especially ﬂash ﬂoods [11–15]. Water resources in El-Qaa Plain were addressed
based on different research tools (i.e., [16–20]). According to the results obtained from these
previous studies, there is a gap in understanding the sustainability of the El-Qaa Plain
coastal aquifer under continuous and increasing pumping process to keep pace with the
recent development activities of land reclamation. Consequently, the El-Qaa Plain region
needs more studies of the recharge mechanisms and discharge (withdrawal) scenarios.
Accordingly, the current work aims to study the recharge mechanisms of the aquifer, and
the current withdrawal operations using mathematical simulations to assess productivity
of the aquifer, in addition to studying the different operating scenarios of water wells and
ﬂow systems with reference to the increased recharge rate, which is expected to occur after
the application of runoff water harvesting (RWH) techniques. These goals are achieved
through the integration of interdisciplinary approaches from hydrochemical, isotope sig-
nature, mathematical ﬂow modeling (MODFLOW), watershed modeling system (WMS),
remote sensing (RS), and geographic information systems (GISs). Isotope signature and
hydrochemistry are vital tools in determining the recent recharge potential of groundwater
aquifers [20–22]. Understanding and quantiﬁcation of the recharge process is signiﬁcant for
protection and sustainable management of the groundwater resources, especially in arid
regions [23–25]. WMS, RS, and GIS are very effective in deﬁning and analyzing watershed
hydro-morphometric characteristics and RWH capabilities [10,18,19,26,27]; MODFLOW is
an important mathematical ﬂow model that quantiﬁes discharge rates and the change in
drawdown with the expected excess discharge of groundwater. It is widely used in water
resources management and planning purposes [28,29]. The applied integration is useful
in understanding the recharge mechanism and groundwater sustainability in coastal and
rift aquifer systems. This research ensemble is an example to be replicated in other similar
coastal areas of the world, especially where data scarcity is an overwhelming problem. All
research tools were integrated to fulﬁll the article’s objective.

2. Site Description and Hydrogeological Setting of El-Qaa Plain Aquifer System
El-Qaa Plain is an oblong alluvial fan of many eastern watersheds that is a major
recharge source for the aquifer [30,31]. The El-Qaa Plain aquifer system is structurally
described as a semi-graben of NW–SE direction, and it makes the eastern boundary of the
Gulf of Suez rift [12,13] (Figure 2). El-Qaa Plain is bounded on the east by Precambrian
basement rocks and on the west by the Gulf of Suez. It is a longitudinal plain that runs
parallel to the Gulf of Suez and is considered an outlet for many watersheds in which
runoff waters and sediments of El-Aawag, Esla, and Thoman watersheds ﬂow into it. It
occupies an area of about 3500 km2 and is considered a promising area for planning land
uses and agricultural activities, as it has a long coastline (about 180 km) with suitable low
surface soil of sand and gravels, which differ signiﬁcantly from the high mountainous hard
rocks adjacent to South Sinai (Figure 2).
The groundwater production area is located at the downstream of El-Aawag water-
shed, which is considered one of the largest basins in the drainage system of the Gulf of
Suez. Accordingly, the El-Aawag watershed was considered as a study area to implement
the research objectives (Figure 1). It has an area of about 1960.75 km2. The main channel
of Wadi El-Aawag watershed extends generally from north–northeast to southwest for
about 58 km according to with the major geological structures and rock contacts, reach-
ing the 6th order (Figure 2a). Its topographic heights range from 5 masl on the western

Water 2023, 15, 1118
4 of 23
side, which is occupied by the El-Qaa Plain area, to high mountains of 2614 masl on the
eastern side, which are represented by the elevated hard rocks of South Sinai (Figure 2b).
Generally, topographic elevations decreased in the westward direction. Wadi El-Aawag
consists of twelve sub-watersheds where the slopes range from gentle slopes to steep slopes
(Figure 2c). The steep slopes are represented by the eastern parts, while the gentle slopes are
occupied by the western side of the watershed. The drainage lines of these sub-watersheds
are mainly starting from the mountainous area towards the El-Qaa Plain and eventually
towards the Gulf of Suez. El-Aawag Trunk Channel sub-watershed constitutes the main
land suitable for agriculture in Wadi El-Aawag watershed and South Sinai, as it is part
of El-Qaa Plain (Figure 2c). It is represented by suitable soils for agriculture in this plain,
especially where proﬁtable groundwater reserves occur in it [32]. The aquifer of El-Qaa
Plain contains thick sediments of sand and gravel with intercalations of clay and silt, and
has recent recharge from runoff water. In addition, the aquifer has a hydraulic conductivity
(K) of about 50 m/day and 43.1% effective porosity (Φ) with 40–50 km2 of water storage
volume, and the water quality of the aquifer will deteriorate as a result of the over-pumping
process within 45 years [16–20]).

features and topographical elevations (based on an accuracy of 30 m ASTER DEM); (c) slope degree
and the names of the sub-basins.
The high mountain range in the eastern part of the study area plays an important role
in the development of this coastal plain. A large number of wadi basins drain into the

Water 2023, 15, 1118
5 of 23
coastal plain, where they originate from these huge granite mountains that form part of the
drainage system of the Gulf of Suez. These wadis were buried in the El-Qaa Plain during
different cycles of sedimentation and heavy rains during the Quaternary era, becoming
active during the rainy periods [33,34]. These basins transport sediments from the source
rocks of the granitic mountains to the gravelly coastal plain. They also represent the main
recharge source for the coastal aquifer, which is fed by seasonal ﬂoods [35].
3. Geologic Setting
Geologically, the W. El-Aawag watershed consists mostly of rocks that ranged from the
Precambrian to the Quaternary (Figure 3). Quaternary sediments occupy mainly the El-Qaa
Plain, which is a promising area for groundwater reserves. The Precambrian rocks varied
between igneous and metamorphic rocks and extend mainly in the eastern side [36,37].
The northeastern part of the watershed is mainly covered by successions that range from
Carboniferous to Miocene rocks (Figure 3). Structurally, the El-Qaa Plain is formed as a
result of the fault of the tectonic structure of the Gulf of Suez and consists of sediments of
the eroded rocks of great thickness [36]. These sediments cover various structures of horst,
half grabens, and normal faults formed through tectonic faulting [20,38].

4. Materials and Methods
Water sustainability was conducted through in the El-Qaa Plain were conducted
through an integrated methodology consisting of multiple ﬁeld trips, sample collection,
and analysis of these samples to achieve isotope analysis and hydrochemistry and then
watershed modeling to verify aquifer recharge and aquifer simulation.
4.1. Site Investigations
Sampling was carried out for twenty-three active pumping and drilling wells repre-
senting the Quaternary aquifer system in the El-Qaa Plain region (Figure 4). Each well
was pumped for ~30 min before sampling until stability in pH value was reached, then
the sample was taken and poured into a clean 500 mL bottle and kept in an ice box. The
collected water samples were sent to laboratories for chemical analysis for major cations
and anions. The pH, total dissolved salts (TDSs), and electrical conductivity (EC) were
measured in situ. Six water samples were selected from the total collected samples for the

Water 2023, 15, 1118

stable isotopic composition of Oxygen-18 (δ O18) and deuterium (D; δ 2H). The samples
were analyzed at the Egyptian Atomic Energy Authority (EAEA). Accurate measurements
of D and O18 in natural waters are almost always made by mass spectrometry [40].

4.2. Data Acquisition
Hydrogeological data (i.e., well depths, lithology, water levels, and discharge rates)
were collected from previous published works, and unpublished groundwater well reports
of the South Sinai Groundwater institute. In addition, the depth of the water level was
measured in many of the observation wells and production wells.
The hydraulic parameters of the mathematical ﬂow model were based on data collected
from JICA [32], pumping test data for production wells, which tap the aquifer system, and
data collected from the “Holding Co. for drinking water and wastewater of Southern Sinai
branch” and data collected from “Water Resource Research Institute (WRRI), South Sinai
branch”, in addition to measurements made by the current working group. All these data
were used as input parameters to construct the model.
4.3. Data Processing
Different data types were used through the present work form differnet sources as
described in Table 1.

4.4. Runoff Calculation
The runoff of W. El-Aawag sub-watersheds was calculated by the method of [43].
Finkel [43] used his method for Wadi Araba, which has similar climatic conditions to
the Sinai Peninsula. It is a simple graphical method for determining the probability
and frequency of annual or seasonal rainfall. Annual precipitation in the El-Qaa Plain
region averaged 10–50 mm/y, and reached 60 mm/y on the tops of the eastern basement
rocks [14,44]. Frequent rainstorms in the study area are widely known for high-velocity
ﬂash ﬂoods [14].
The empirical Finkel method [43] uses the following parameters (Equations (1) and (2)):
Peak ﬂood ﬂow (Qmax)
Qmax = K1A0.67
(1)
where Qmax is the peak ﬂood ﬂow in cubic meters/sec.
Annual ﬂood volume (v) in 1000 cubic meters
V = K2A0.67
(2)
where A is the area of the basin in km2, and K1 and K2 are constants according to the
probability of occurrence:
Probability of occurrence 10% in a given year:
K1 K2
1.58 26.5
We used 10% here because it is very suitable for development conditions and cli-
mate uncertainty.
4.5. Mathematical Groundwater Flow Model
A three-dimensional ﬁnite difference model was developed using MODFLOW [45] to
simulate the aquifer in the study area. Several data (i.e., aquifer boundaries, groundwater
levels, rock succession, well depth, aquifer water-bearing layers, discharge, and recharge
rates) were used to build the model. Visual MODFLOW 3.1 [46] is the most complete and
user-friendly modeling platform for practical 3D groundwater ﬂow simulation. MOD-
FLOW numerically solves the three-dimensional groundwater ﬂow equation for porous
media using the ﬁnite differential method. The partial differential equation for groundwater
ﬂow used in MODFLOW is the Equation (3):

∂y

+ ∂




+ W = Ss∂h
∂t
(3)
where Kxx, Kyy, and Kzz are the values of hydraulic conductivity along the coordinates
of the x-, y-, and z-axes, which are assumed to be parallel to the major axes of hydraulic
conductivity (L/T); h is the piezometric head (L); W is the volumetric ﬂux per unit volume
representing sources and/or basin water, with W < 0.0 for ﬂow out of the groundwater

system, and W > 0.0 for ﬂow in (T−1) (negative values are extractions, positive values are
injections (T−1); SS is the speciﬁc storage of the porous material (L−1); t is time (T).
When groundwater ﬂow equation is equalized along with the boundary and initial con-
ditions, it describes the 3D transient groundwater ﬂow in a homogeneous and anisotropic
medium, provided that the principal axes of hydraulic conductivity are consistent with
the coordinate directions. The groundwater ﬂow process solves the groundwater ﬂow
equation using the ﬁnite-differential method, in which the groundwater ﬂow system is
divided into a grid of cells; for each cell, there is one point, called the node, at which head
is calculated [45].
5. Results and Discussions
5.1. Hydrochemistry and Isotopes as Guides for Determining Groundwater Recharge Potential
An important question that should be asked frequently is “how sustainable are the
water resources to cope with on-going or planned development activities?” In other words,
are these water resources renewable or not? Accordingly, the source of groundwater in the
El-Qaa Plain was veriﬁed using the “stable environmental isotopes” of Oxygen-18 (δO18)
and deuterium (D; δ2H) and chemical composition. The isotopic ratios of hydrogen and
oxygen are ideal tracing tools for the origin and evolution of groundwater, because they are
composed of water molecules and are sensitive to physical processes such as atmospheric
circulation, groundwater mixing, and evaporation [47,48]. Stable-isotopic values of δO18,
δ2H, and/or the excess deuterium (D) in precipitation are useful indicators of various
parameters in the water cycle [49–51]. Environmental isotopes are a very important and
vital tool for determining groundwater recharge potentials from runoff water [52,53]. On
the other hand, geochemical indices play an important role in determining the groundwater
origin and recharge source and solving many problems in hydrogeology, especially in semi-
arid and arid regions [47,54].
Total dissolved solids of the analyzed groundwater samples for the El-Qaa Plain’s
Quaternary aquifer ranged between 326.4 ppm for sample No. 9 and 2261 ppm for sample
No. 23 (Table 2). TDS values for samples 1 through 21 have TDS values of less than
1000 ppm which indicate fresh water types that reﬂect the probability of recent groundwater
recharge with runoff water. Samples No. 22 and 23 had TDS values above 1000 ppm
indicating the brackish water type (Table 2). The water samples analyzed in the El-Qaa
Plain showed the presence of Na, Ca, Cl, and HCO3 ions almost in all analyzed samples in
representative proportions, indicating water recharge in the El-Qaa Plain aquifer through
recent and ancient precipitation events, as well as the contribution of ancient water and the
impact of the interaction between water and rocks.
The samples analyzed show the water type of NaCl on a Piper diagram (Figure 5).
This water type reﬂects the dominance of sodium and chloride ions in all water samples,
which may reﬂect the effect of saltwater intrusion from the Gulf of Suez that is reﬂecting
the footprints of mixing facies, where the same samples show the low salinity values as
mentioned above, despite the effect of mixing processes. Accordingly, the assumption of
this type of water is attributed to the presence of intercalations of clay and evaporites inside
the aquifer succession. This assumption is also consistent with the ﬁndings of [20,44,55],
where they reported the interaction of hydrated rocks for the dominance of the sodium and
chloride ions in the same region. They also indicated that the uplifting of the impermeable
Paleocene crystalline and carboniferous rocks of Gebel El Qebliat Mountain led to the
isolation of most parts of the groundwater-producing layer from the saltwater in the Gulf
of Suez. The saltwater intrusion in this area extends to only a few hundred meters. The
rNa/Cl ionic ratio values exceed those of seawater (0.852 rNa/Cl epm; [56]) for all samples
analyzed except for samples 22 and 23 (Na/Cl values of 0.65 and 0.55 epm, respectively)
(Table 2). These values indicate the effect of the interaction between groundwater and
aquifer materials [57]. This is also indicated by the values of the rCl/HCO3 ratio, which
is a very important ratio showing severe water contamination with sea water (near sea
water) (>15.5 epm ([57–60]). All analyzed samples have rCl/HCO3 values far from that

Water 2023, 15, 1118
9 of 23
of seawater except for samples 22 and 23 (rCl/HCO3: 4.29 and 6.26, respectively). The
values of the rCl/HCO3 ratio for inland water range between 0.1 and 5 and for sea water
between 20 and 50 [61]. Accordingly, samples 22 and 23 may also be affected by the inﬂux
of seawater from the Gulf of Suez, where the samples are nearest to it.

The stable environmental ratios of isotopes O18 and D are expressed according to the
slope deviation (‰) of the ratio 18O/16O or 2H/1H versus Standard Mean Ocean Water
(SMOW) according to the following equation [40] (Equation (4)):
δsample%o = [(Rsample - Rstandard)/Rstandard × 1000]
(4)
where R represents the ratios of 18O/16O and 2H/1H for the samples and the standard
value, respectively.
The results of the analyzed samples showed that O18 differs between −4.84 for the
sample No. 12 (Well No. 29) and −6.28 for sample No. 21 (Well No. 5). Deuterium values
range from −21.7 for sample No. 12 (Well No. 29) and −29.87 for sample No. 21 (Well
No. 5) (Figure 6 and Table 3).

The standard graph of δ 18O/δ 2H shows the position of all samples relative to the
Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL: δ2H = 8 δ18O + 10) [40] and the Mediterranean
Precipitation Water Line (MWL: δ2H = 8 δ18O + 22) [62], which are plotted as reference
lines. Rainwater and Gulf of Suez samples [63], the Hammam Musa sample [64], and
rainwater for the two weather stations in El-Arish and Rafah [65] are shown in the graph
(Figure 6). It is observed from Figure 6 that all analyzed water samples lie between the

Water 2023, 15, 1118
11 of 23
Mediterranean Precipitation (rainwater) Line and the Global Meteoric Water Line around
the rainwater reference sample [63], which reﬂects the presence of signiﬁcant recharge from
the new continental and Mediterranean rains, in addition to precipitated water from the
prevailing wet climatic periods. The differences in the isotopic composition of the water
samples collected with respect to the samples of the Gulf of Suez and Hammam Musa
(Musa Bath) represent different degrees of mixing between the two end members; one is
fossil water deposited by intense ancient water that occurred in past cold and wet climatic
systems, and the other is modern rain falling in dry and warm climatic conditions [21]. This
assumption is observed in samples No. 21 and 8 which show some depletion in isotopic
values compared with the other samples, which indicates mixing with ancient waters from
deep aquifers through fault systems in South Sinai or mixing with ancient water from the
ancient rainstorms.
The slightly enriched isotopic composition of the analyzed samples (δ18O and δ2H)
reﬂects recent recharge from runoff water during recent precipitation events. This is
largely seen in samples No. 11, 12, 13, and 16. By comparing the values of δ18O and
δ2H for the analyzed samples with the recent average precipitation in the cities of El-
Arish and Rafah in North Sinai [65], which have average values of −3.73 and −3.62 for
δ18O, and −8.75 and −7.55 for δ2H at the two weather stations in El-Arish and Rafah,
respectively, it is observed that they also occur between the Global Meteoric Water Line
(GMWL) and the Mediterranean Precipitation Water Line (MPWL) (Figure 6), which reﬂects
a good correlation between them and the analyzed water samples, indicating a recent
groundwater recharge from recent rainstorms. This is clearly seen in samples No. 11 and 12.
It also indicates that fractured bedrock in the upstream parts (catchment areas) is directly
recharged by rainwater. Moreover, the excess of D is another evidence for the origin of
groundwater recharge (Table 3), which is calculated by Equation (5) [48]:
dexcess = δD‰ −818O‰
(5)
Several studies have attempted to use differences in dexcess values to determine the
time and origin of groundwater recharge under different climatic conditions [47,64,66].
The dexcess values for the analyzed groundwater samples ranged between 10.49 (Sample
No. 16) and 21.17 (Sample No. 21). All samples have a dexcess of more than 10‰ (>10‰),
reﬂecting the recent recharge of the aquifer system. An excess D value of about 10 reﬂects
groundwater replenishment under wetter climatic conditions during earlier times [64,67,68].
This assumption was fulﬁlled in sample No. 16 (Table 3). Low dexcess values (<10‰)
reﬂect the contribution of ancient water through faults, dykes, and deep-rooted joints,
while high dexcess (>10‰) reﬂects the recent recharge from precipitation in the eastern
Mediterranean region [66,69].
Finally, the evidence of recent groundwater recharge potential in the El-Qaa Plain
provides an optimistic view about the future of on-going or planned development activities.
From this point of view, the runoff water represents the main source of groundwater
recharge, which must be managed to increase recharge capability.
5.2. Runoff Water Management
The runoff water is calculated for the sub-watersheds in the El-Aawag watershed
using the Finkel method, as shown in Equations (1) and (2) and Table 4. The runoff water
harvesting (RWH) plan for W. El-Aawag is to increase the chance for water inﬁltration
in El-Qaa groundwater aquifer system. This occurs by increasing the chance of water
intrusion into the bottom aquifer system by increasing the lag time (the residence time of
the water on the ground surface), taking into account the need for periodic maintenance
of the bottom of the reservoir upstream of the dam. This plan will be achieved through
the construction of three proposed dams across the sub-watersheds of Amlaha, Maier,
and Habran (Figures 7 and 8). These dams are located in the upstream parts of these
sub-watersheds in the main channels of wadi deposits and are bounded on both sides
by the shoulders of the basement. The sediments have high inﬁltration rates, porosity,

Water 2023, 15, 1118
12 of 23
and permeability [14,70], which enhances groundwater recharge as well as helps mitigate
ﬂood risks. Construction cross sections at the dam sites in the WMS© software (Aquaveo
LLC, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research & Development Center) (Figure 7)
indicated storage capacities of 90,000, 350,000, and 350,000 m3/ y for the sub-watersheds of
Amlaha, Maier, and Habran, respectively. These dams, if engineered with optimal designs,
constructions and management systems, will help provide promising amounts of runoff
water, especially with heavy rainstorms. Based on the above results of hydrochemistry,
hydrology of environmental isotopes, and the proposed system of RWH, groundwater
productivity of the El-Qaa Plain aquifer is examined using mathematical ﬂow models to
build a complete view of the water resources in arid regions.

5.3. Mass Balance and Flow Modeling
The MODFLOW modeling code was used to envisage the relationship of groundwater
withdrawal and water level restoration for different scenarios of discharge. MODFLOW
is used globally to study the groundwater levels of coastal aquifers [71] and assess the
interaction of groundwater levels and stream-aquifers [72]. MODFLOW is also a very
effective modeling code for the numerical assessment of the managed aquifer recharge
(MAR) to achieve sustainable groundwater development [73].
The conceptual model was built based on the topographic, geological, and hydrogeo-
logical studies conducted on the aquifer system (Figure 9a). The hydrogeological map of
Sinai at scale of 1:500,000 [32] is the main source of model data, as well as data collected
from ﬁeld trips carried out to South Sinai, and previous instrumental data and the database
of pumping wells.
The hydrogeological environment in El-Qaa Plain region was classiﬁed into three units
related to the Pleistocene aquifer (Figure 9a) [32]:
The upper part consists of coarse gravel with sand and is found in the shallow zone
in a limited area around the city of El-Tur. In general, a high electrical resistance value
(>100 ohm-m) indicates no water reserve. The middle part is about 100 m thick, 60 km
long, and 10 km wide, occupies about 600 km2, and consists of coarse to medium sand
and gravel with interfering of clay lenses. It is the main source of fresh water extraction.
It has no distribution in the southern part of El-Qaa Plain, where its electrical resistance
is 10–50 ohm-m. The bottom consists of sand and gravel with silt and clay. It represents
the third aquifer zone, which is less productive than the second aquifer. Its resistance is
less than 10 ohm-m and this represents water that may be of low quality. Its thickness may
exceed 1000 m.

Figure 9. (a) Conceptual (schematic) cross-section of El-Qaa Plain (after [32]); (b) model grids showing
rows, columns, active, and inactive cells; (c) model boundary conditions.
The model has rectangular dimensions of 60,324 m in width and 65,380 m in height to
represent an active aquifer dimension of 66 km (maximum length) and 24 km (maximum
width). The number of rows and columns is 200 and 200, respectively (Figure 9b). The active
cells represent the investigated aquifer system, which is represented by the Quaternary
water-bearing deposits, while the inactive cells represent the impervious boundaries of
the eastern basement rocks and the western rocks of Mountain Qabaliat. The 3D grid
was generated by producing three surfaces, which were digitized using Surfer8® Package
Software (http://www.ssg-surfer.com/html/surfer_details.html, accessed on 5 May 2020)
(Scientiﬁc Software Group). A grid ﬁle is then produced for each surface, bearing in mind
that the surface grid cell size must be smaller than the model grid cell size to accurately
import these surfaces into the model.
Boundary conditions are essential parameters for constructing a ﬂow model, as they
represent the relationship between the studied aquifer system and the surrounding systems.
They also describe the ﬂow and exchange communication between the model and the
surrounding external systems. The model region boundary conditions are shown in
Figure 9c.
The boundary conditions surrounding the Quaternary aquifer of the El-Qaa Plain
are classiﬁed into: The eastern boundary, which is considered a recharge boundary, as
it receives recharge from the runoff water of W. El-Aawag watershed, especially from
W. Habran, W. Maier, and Gebah sub-watersheds. The El-Aawag watershed receives an
annual volume of runoff of about 9,163,812 m3, which was calculated in the present work
by the Finkel’s Method [43]. On the other hand, the recharge amount from the watersheds
surrounding the aquifer system from the eastern side is about 5.9 MCM/yr [32,74,75].
The western boundary of the model is represented by a constant head condition, which

Water 2023, 15, 1118
15 of 23
represents the zero head of the Gulf of Suez. This boundary condition is assigned to all
three layers of the model. The no-ﬂow boundary represents the areas of no ﬂow into the
aquifer system. This boundary condition is assigned to the three layers of the model for the
remaining sides of the aquifer system.
The hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer ranges between 4.6 and 71.6 m/day with
an average value of 23.9 m/day. The transmissivity (T) of the aquifer ranges between 106
and 2150 m2/day with an average value of 768 m2/day. The storage capacity (Sc) varies
between 0.33 and 6.11 with an average value of 2.64. Well production (Q) ranges between
20 and 115 m3/h, with an average value of 56.7 m3/h [32]. The Water Resources Research
Institute (WRRI) monitored the static water level in El-Qaa Plain periodically by some
observation wells from 1989 to 1997, where piezometric levels ranged from 5 masl near the
city of El-Tur to 25 masl in the central part of El-Qaa Plain. It decreases by 6–7 cm/year with
a gradient of 0.6/1000. Through this study, the water level was measured in six observation
wells in El-Qaa Plain region by the research team and it was found at 4.9, 15, 10, 15, 25, and
10 masl.
The pumping wells in the study area are increasing epidemically with the passage
of time, consequently, the amount of extracted groundwater is also increasing, which
necessitates the need for a simultaneous increase in the recharge rate through the application
of the new proposed RWH techniques, which is the vital objective of the current work.
It is noticed from the ﬁeld trips to the El-Qaa Plain that there is a noticeable increase in
agricultural activities during the last ten years, especially those owned by the private
sector with large areas, each with one or more pumping wells. All of these wells mainly
rely on the El-Qaa Quaternary aquifer system, which leads to an increase in the rate of
groundwater extraction. Table 5 describes the increase in groundwater extraction due to
increased agricultural activities in El-Qaa Plain region.

5.3.1. Model Calibration
The model was calibrated against the average available groundwater piezometric
levels for six observation wells. The calibration of the model is based on non-linear steady-
state conditions. The calibration process was carried out through several experiments by
adjusting the hydraulic conductivity. The piezometric level ranges between 35 masl in the
northern part of the study area and 5 masl in the southwestern part, near the city El-Tur
(Figure 10a). The general ﬂow direction is from the east to west in the southern half of
the study area, while it is from northwest to east–west in the northern half of the study
area (Figure 10b). The model is found to be sensitive to changes in hydraulic conductivity,
speciﬁc head along the boundaries, groundwater recharge, and extraction from the aquifer
system (Figure 10c; Table 6).

5.3.2. Selection and Testing Scenarios
In the present work, the primary criteria used to establish a groundwater development
strategy include:
The calibrated model provides a prediction of the response of the aquifer system as
a result of different groundwater extraction scenarios relative to the incremental rate of
recharge scenarios. Based on the main control for the rate of safe extraction, which can
be maintained below the short-term depletion program, the following should be taken
into consideration:
(a)
Avoid complete dewatering of the aquifer system in any part of the development area,
where extraction from the system is envisaged;
(b)
Keep the pumping head within the acceptable limit for the management period.
The tested scenarios are proposed to serve the sustainability of the aquifer under the
inﬂuence of:
1.
Increasing the rate of discharge due to the implementation of new development
activities, especially the new reclaimed lands;
2.
Possibility of aquifer recharge through the proposed runoff water harvesting structures.
Scenario #1:
In this scenario, the extraction rate is increased by about 3600 m3/day, indicating
the need to add new wells (10 pumping wells) which increases the extraction rate. These
wells were proposed to provide additional quantities of water to meet the new agricultural
activities. When running this scenario, it is observed from the results (Table S1, Figure 12a)
that there is a slight decrease in piezometric heads in the observation wells with an average

Water 2023, 15, 1118
18 of 23
value of 0.44 masl. Thus, this scenario is suitable for additional water supply, as it results in
a slight change in piezometric heads in response to this pumping rate.
 
Figure 12. Flow directions and piezometric heads: (a) model scenario No. 1; (b) model scenario No. 2.
Scenario #2:
Model scenario No. 2 was proposed to study the impact of intense extraction from the
studied aquifer as a result of the noticeable increase in the number of drilled groundwater
wells. In this scenario, the model was run at twice the extraction rates compared with the
baseline (double the baseline) from the same well ﬁeld. It is noted that there is a signiﬁcant
difference between calculated piezometric heads for the baseline and those for the second
scenario, ranging from 2.7 masl for Well No. 1 and 9.05 masl for Well No. 6, with an
average value of 6.97 masl (Table S2 and Figure 12b). This large difference causes higher
drawdown values and piezometric heads to fall below zero values in wells located near the
Gulf of Suez, which consequently leads saltwater intrusion into the aquifer (Figure 12b).
Therefore, we recommend that any increase in the extraction rate be within the safe yield
and under control to protect the aquifer from saltwater invasion. However, the drilling of
groundwater wells and rates of extraction from the El-Qaa Plain aquifer system must be
under government monitoring and oversight.
The present work proposed new techniques for evaluating the groundwater reserves
in South Sinai, especially in the El-Qaa Plain region, to increase the recharge rates of the
Quaternary aquifer system, which is mainly fed by the runoff water coming from the
eastern catchments. Therefore, we propose a new a new scenario to increase the aquifer
recharge rate by 2%, which can be achieved by applying RWH constructions. This scenario
was applied to the three cases (i.e., baseline, addition of new wells, and doubling the
extraction rate, respectively).
Scenario #3 (increasing recharge rate by 2% for the baseline):
When running the model for this scenario, it was observed that the increase in piezo-
metric water level varied from 0.08 masl in Well No. 3 to 0.19 masl in Well No. 5, with an
average value of 0.13 masl (Table S3). Flow direction and piezometric heads resulted from
scenario No. 3 is shown in Figure 13a.

19 of 23
 
Figure 13. Flow direction and piezometric heads: (a) scenario No. 3; (b) scenario No. 4; (c) scenario No. 5.
Scenario #4 (2% increase in recharge rate, if new wells are added to the well ﬁeld):
When the model for this scenario is run, it is observed that the drawdown ranges
between 0.1 masl in Well No. 1 to 0.58 m in Well No. 6, with an average value of 0.37 masl
(Table S4), while the average drawdown in the case of scenario No. 1 (add 10 new wells)
was 0.44 masl. Flow directions and piezometric heads that resulted from scenario No. 4 are
shown in Figure 13b.
Scenario #5 (increase the recharge rate by 2 % if the extraction rate is doubled):
Running the model for this scenario, the drawdown was observed to range between
2.58 masl in Well No. 1 to 8.93 masl in Well No. 6 with an average value of 6.85 masl
(Table S5), while the average drawdown in the case of scenario 2 (doubling the extraction
rate) was 6.97 masl. Thus, it is also observed that by increasing the recharge rate, the
drawdown is very high, and there is a high chance of saltwater intrusion from the Gulf of
Suez. Figure 13c shows the ﬂow directions and piezometric heads, which were a result of
Scenario 5, where heads below zero are also represented by wells that occur near the Gulf
of Suez.
6. Conclusions
The management of water resources in the Sinai Peninsula is an urgent need for
future developmental activities. The present work provided successful integration of
mathematical ﬂow modeling (MODFLOW), RS, GIS, WMS, hydrochemistry, and isotope
hydrology (O18 and D) to understand groundwater quality, recharge mechanisms, and

Water 2023, 15, 1118

current and future discharge rates of the El-Qaa Plain aquifer. In addition to studying the
possibility of improving natural groundwater recharge conditions by suggesting rainwater
harvesting structures to enhance the aquifer storage and productivity, the relationship
between surface runoff water and groundwater was investigated and different scenarios of
groundwater discharge rates under new agricultural activities was presented. The results
indicated that the drilling of additional wells in the El-Qaa Plain aquifer system must be
under strict control, and their operation should be within safe withdrawal rates to keep
the aquifer away from high drawdown and saltwater intrusion. Finally, the application of
optimal rainwater harvesting techniques have its own effect on enhancing the potential for
groundwater recharge possibilities, which in turn, increases its sustainability for current and
future development requirements. For this same clue, the isotope signatures (O18 and D)
indicate recent recharge and ancient waters. Three storage dams in the sub-watersheds
of Habran, Maier, and Amlaha have been proposed to harvest surface runoff water, thus
enhancing groundwater recharge into the aquifer. If adapted and managed wisely, these
dams will help to harvest promising amounts of runoff water, particularly through intense
rainstorms, helping to mitigate ﬂash ﬂoods and enhance the ecosystem in these arid regions.
